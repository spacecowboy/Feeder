fixed the first day of the month. Example:</p>

<p>If we graph the interest rates we get:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2018/03/rates.en.png" alt="Interest rates over time" /></p>

<p>You can see a clear peak in the variable rate when the riksbank set
the repo rate at 500% (mortgages &ldquo;only&rdquo; reached 24%). You can also see
that during the early nineties the variable rate was higher than the
fixed rates during relatively long periods. But to compare the actual
cost over the fixed term we have to compare average rates.</p>

<p>For example, let us compare the actual average rates from the first of
July 1991 during 5 years for variable rate (11.96%) and 5 years fixed
term (12.25%). Even though with variable rate you&rsquo;d have had a rate of
24% during a quarter you&rsquo;d still pay less in total over the 5 years.</p>

<p>If the same calculation is made for every month you can see how much
you would have earned/lost depending on when you started your fixed
term. Since 5 years is not evenly divisible by 2 years, the 2 years
fixed term refers to what the average rate would have been during the
first 5 of the 6 years.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2018/03/5y_avg_rates.en.png" alt="Average interest rate over 5 years" /></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s quite clear that variable rate has nearly always been the most
profitable alternative. At three seperate occasions it would have been
more profitable to pick a 5 year fixed term: at the of 1989, the
beginning of 1997, and in the middle of 2005. I won&rsquo;t comment on the 2
years fixed term since it&rsquo;s not a fair comparison to only look at 5 out of
6 years.</p>

<p>If we compare 2 years fixed term with variable rate:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2018/03/2y_avg_rates.en.png" alt="Average interest rate over 2 years" /></p>

<p>Also here the most profitable choice is generally the variable rate
however during times of rising interest rates getting a fixed 2 year
term has been the better choice on several occasions. An important
difference to the 5 years term is that you&rsquo;re not locked in for long
when the rates finally go down again (and you&rsquo;re able to switch to
variable rate).</p>

<p>If we compare all terms during 10 years:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2018/03/10y_avg_rates.en.png" alt="Average interest rate over 10 years" /></p>

<p>Here it is clear that the variable rate is the most profitable.</p>

<p>Even though it has been possible at certain occasions (29 years and
only 3 short occasions!) to get a fixed term for 5 years and pay less
overall than with variable rate, I think it&rsquo;s far too improbable that
one is able to do it at the right time. You&rsquo;re almost guaranteed to be
paying more in the end.</p>

<p>Getting a fixed term for 2 years is more probable to be profitable,
but even here it is more probable not to be.</p>

<p>When you have apps in Google Play (and I imagine, other App stores as well), the amount of spam you receive instantly goes up by a factor of 10. Google&rsquo;s spam filters are pretty well trained but every now and again something gets through.</p>

<h2 id="advertising-opportunity">Advertising opportunity</h2>

<p>Today&rsquo;s piece of bullshyt (I really meant to spell it like that) reads as follows (my emphasis):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our premium advertisers are currently looking to buy android traffic at a very high price in apps like Nononsense Notes.</p>

<p>We think you can generate up to $10 CPM with their <strong>full screen ads</strong>, which are <strong>very clean</strong>. Indeed, most of our advertisers are willing to pay, on average, between $1 and $3 per installation. You&rsquo;re free to display these ads whenever you want in your app so that it&rsquo;s <strong>not intrusive</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ads are by definition <em>intrusive</em>. That&rsquo;s how they nag you into buying their stupid stuff. And it doesn&rsquo;t matter how clean your ads are. Displaying them fullscreen is <em>beyond</em> intrusive. It is down right <strong>offensive</strong>.</p>

<p>I uninstall anything that displays obnoxious ads, be they fullscreen or notifications, and promptly give the app a one star review. I sincerely hope others afford me the same &ldquo;courtesy&rdquo; for my apps.</p>
