<ul>
<li><p>The design of Unix OS<br />
<a href="http://160592857366.free.fr/joe/ebooks/ShareData/Design%20of%20the%20Unix%20Operating%20System%20By%20Maurice%20Bach.pdf">http://160592857366.free.fr/joe/ebooks/ShareData/Design%20of%20the%20Unix%20Operating%20System%20By%20Maurice%20Bach.pdf</a></p>

<p>This is complementary to "The classic, the beautiful" of issue 105. Get
your source from this issue and image from the next link. It goes in
depth into the thinking needed to build an OS. As with this type of
content, this is quite a big read so enjoy it over a long period or
until you get bored, which hopefully will take some time.</p></li>
<li><p>Installing research Unix<br />

<p>This is to go alongside with the previous link. The instructions are
clear and simple to follow, enjoy! Kind of similar to "Doing it in V7"
of 58.</p></li>
<li><p>An upgrade<br />
<a href="https://github.com/hughpyle/ASR33">https://github.com/hughpyle/ASR33</a></p>

<p>Or how to connect the old to the new, quite an adventure in terminal
land.</p></li>
<li><p>A user's view of the OS<br />

<p>To take the place of your user and give them what they need you first
need to know who your users are. That first link lists everything
that is required, and not so often thought about, to create a usable
OS interface. A reminder of "Ever installed a Unix-like system for a
friend who's not techie?" in issue 54.  And finishing with yet another
of those trendy OpenBSD on a laptop type of post.</p></li>

<p>Let's see how an init and service/daemon manager could be implemented
simply and effectively, are you interested in this, does it entice you?</p></li>

<p>This week we switch the focus to NTP (see number 5 again), have a
discussion about things we may not directly think about that affect
time precision, and that finally leads us to talk about PTP for when
NTP is not enough. Some interesting things to keep in mind: ppm, parts
per million of beats can be used to measure clock accuracy, normalized
frequency offset is also called drift. This will take us next week on
the journey of real time clock, real time Unix systems, and maybe the
use of time in distributed computing or other time sensitive operations.</p></li>

<p>Building static binaries isn't that easy, this project aims at making
it easier by providing recipe to do this.</p></li>
<li><p>A post from that blog to follow<br />

<p>Remember the "New blog to follow" of 58, in this article we do a
roundup of the C89 standard, a quick brief overview... Well brief but
still quite thorough and entertaining.</p></li>
<li><p>Getting inspired by OpenBSD<br />

<p>I find this case to be a convincing one, this is something that is
required these days and that probably needs to be standardized across
the Unix panoply.</p></li>
<li><p>APT getting it again<br />
<a href="https://justi.cz/security/2019/01/22/apt-rce.html">https://justi.cz/security/2019/01/22/apt-rce.html</a></p>

<p>Remember "Nagging about Debian" in 63 and "APT and https" in 60,
this is an update on the topic.</p></li>
<li><p>Bonus<br />
<a href="https://markplusplus.wordpress.com/2006/10/01/pitch-correct-play-speed-with-mplayer/">https://markplusplus.wordpress.com/2006/10/01/pitch-correct-play-speed-with-mplayer/</a></p>

<p>I've been listening to a lot of talks recently and speeding up the
tempo changes the pitch, so if you don't want everyone to sound like a
martian this will help. I've also learned that <code>mpv</code> has this behavior
by default or through <code>--audio-pitch-correction</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>Reminiscence of the olden' days<br />

<p>I like it when someone applies their expertise of the past to a problem
that they find similar in the present. Here we're discussing containers
and showing a demo while saving a lot in the size of the image. As
an extra there's a deep well thought meditation about the topic of
multi-factor authentication, highly recommended.</p></li>
<li><p>Desktop Pausing<br />
<a href="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/2018/09/19/freebsd-desktop-part-16-configuration-pause-any-application/">https://vermaden.wordpress.com/2018/09/19/freebsd-desktop-part-16-configuration-pause-any-application/</a></p>

<p>One of the perfect and useful example of last week 109 "What's that
wmutils thingish on suckless rocks list".</p></li>
<li><p>Looking for answers<br />
<a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/885/gilles">https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/885/gilles</a></p>

<p>One of the top contributors in the Unix section of stackexchange,
his replies are thorough and straight to the point.</p></li>
<li><p>Making things colorful<br />
<a href="http://jvns.ca/zines">http://jvns.ca/zines</a></p>

<p>If you've never heard of this blogger this is your lucky day. There's
a lot of book and helping sheets on the website in the same style as
<code>_why</code>, no wonder the author is also involved in ruby.</p></li>
<li><p>Xenix tales<br />
<a href="https://github.com/retrohun/blog/tree/master/dt/xenixtales">https://github.com/retrohun/blog/tree/master/dt/xenixtales</a></p>

<p>This jumped in the news recently, it's fun to have a blog hosted on
github but inside of a readme instead of a github page.</p></li>
<li><p>Explaining what is FreeBSD without shooting yourself in the foot<br />
<a href="https://www.fossmint.com/what-is-freebsd-why-should-you-choose-it-over-linux/">https://www.fossmint.com/what-is-freebsd-why-should-you-choose-it-over-linux/</a></p>

<p>Actually, scrap that title aside, it's not a perfect article at all.
See also "And BSD for the Linux guys and gals" of issue 40 which was
a bit better.</p></li>
<li><p>FreeBSD malware<br />
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT_k06Xg-BE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT_k06Xg-BE</a></p>

<p>Remember all that talk about PLT/GOT we had previously, well it's
paying off, we're now able to understand what this talk is about. Also
a continuation of "BSD hacking and security" in issue 63.</p></li>
<li><p>Memory safety on Linux<br />
<a href="https://blog.araj.me/state-of-memory-safety-in-linux/">https://blog.araj.me/state-of-memory-safety-in-linux/</a><br />

<p>With all that talk about FreeBSD we're interested in a refreshment,
let's see what's up in the Linux world. We could've checked OpenBSD but
we're too used to jumping in that direction when it comes to security.</p></li>

<p>Let's first review the first issue "Keeping time and date (1)" to
refresh our memory about what is time and if days are really 24h. Are
there instruments available to measure time precisely, how do they take
into account the earth uneven speed. We want to still track time as a
drift from that stable time but how do we propagate the changes, let's
hear again about leap seconds and the new concept of smear time. And
we finish with the introduction to the standard method to propagate
external time, to sync up with the world and the sources of precise
time, along with different examples on how to do that.</p></li>
<li><p>TTY, change?<br />
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/343828/">https://lwn.net/Articles/343828/</a></p>

<p>Traveling back to 2009 to remind us of the state of the TTY
infrastructure on Linux, and mostly in general what needs to be
supported and expected from all platforms.</p></li>

<a href="http://marmaro.de/docs/studium/unix-phil/unix-phil.pdf">http://marmaro.de/docs/studium/unix-phil/unix-phil.pdf</a></p>

<p>We often hear the "what is" or "how to", this paper is about the
"why is".</p></li>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_J-itJDwM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_J-itJDwM</a></p>

<p>A really beautiful and approachable presentation about the BSD FFS,
data storage on Unix is so much fun. A highly recommended talk.</p></li>

<a href="https://dataswamp.org/~solene/2017-03-17-integrity.html">https://dataswamp.org/~solene/2017-03-17-integrity.html</a></p>

<p>We might have mentioned bitrot indirectly in this newsletter so let's
do it explicitly now. This article should cover the basic concept.</p></li>
<li><p>Remember university days?<br />
<a href="http://fabiensanglard.net/floating_point_visually_explained/">http://fabiensanglard.net/floating_point_visually_explained/</a></p>

<p>Are you a university student and want to refresh your memory about how
to encoding floats or maybe you've never seen those before, don't worry
it's all explained in there. It's all about finding a way to represent
and pack information in bits, just like what we saw in 71 "Let's play
with encoding and formats" or 61 "ID3 tags" and many more issues before.</p></li>
<li><p>Process infection<br />
<a href="https://www.tarlogic.com/en/blog/linux-process-infection-part-i/">https://www.tarlogic.com/en/blog/linux-process-infection-part-i/</a></p>

<p>How to hide your mischevious deeds without them being noticed
spontaneously, this is what is tackled in this article. It's only the
tip though, the first one in the series touching listing processes
that can be ptraceable.</p></li>

<p>Let's take a small pause from the kernel stuff and start reviewing
again DST, and slowly introducing the topic of NTP.</p></li>

<p>You might or might not like what this person is doing on their platform
but it still deserves some attention.</p></li>

<p>It's my first time cloning the Arcan project and trying it first hand
by going through the tutorial, it's really nifty, give it a try. It
gives that gaming framework vibe which is quite interesting and makes
you wonder about what kind of user interfaces could possibly look like.</p></li>
<li><p>What's that wmutils thingish on suckless rocks list<br />

<p>I wrote an article to clarify things to those who get confused about
X11 window manipulation utilities and for everyone else who simply
are looking for new ideas. This was principally made to cover only
wmutils but I thought of making it broader.</p></li>

<p>We started a bit last week with the types of hardware clocks the kernel
can rely on, it's the point that we will focus on this time. Where
is time stored on a machine, what actually ticks. As a bonus in this
series and because it should be part of it, I'm adding again "What
is time" from 85, this should include some ideas that will introduce
future topics.</p></li>

as race conditions, we review a tale from the old days about atomic
writes. You can get "The classic, the beautiful" from 105 and tag along.</p></li>

<h2>Thoughts</h2>

<p>This is the first fressh issue of this new year. As cliché as it sounds
let's emphasize some thoughts about change.</p>

<p>Remember those "Culture clash" from 86 and "Edge effect" from 84, let's
start on this tone. Give yourself permission to make yourself a priority,
at least for a while. Try out new things, or continue what you've left
behind, or simply grow on the same path.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"We often underestimate our capacity to reinvent ourselves" - Shankar Vedantam</p>

<p>Let's start this issue with a continuation of this series. Those
should answer the following questions: What are the types of times:
hardware and system (more on it later), how to get/set the current
times, how to set the current timezone, what is this Unix/POSIX time
we often hear about, what is one source of time (also more on it for
next issues, leaving it ambiguous for now).</p></li>

<p>Linux for forensic, this reminds me of "Command line for the data
scientists" in 72, Linux can be for anyone. This is really just
introductory (and a bit outdated), touching the basis but could still
be considered a follow up on "We discussed a lot of forensic..." in 56,
"File system forensic" in 43, "A forensic version of dd" in 42, and
"Data security" in 73.</p></li>

<p>I knew the Arch wiki was good but I'm still surprised by how thorough
the security article is. As for all the rest of the content you can
enjoy how security can be implemented in so many different ways, this
covers a lot of ground. Maybe you can also read again about PAM, it's
been a long time, "Everything you need to know about PAM" in issue 12.</p></li>

<h2>Unix</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>How programs are loaded<br />
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/630727/">https://lwn.net/Articles/630727/</a><br />
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/631631/">https://lwn.net/Articles/631631/</a></p>

<p>Let's start with a question: How are programs loaded, what are they
made of, and what's the link with the kernel.</p></li>
<li><p>What is an ELF<br />
<a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/ELF">https://wiki.osdev.org/ELF</a><br />
<a href="http://www.cirosantilli.com/elf-hello-world/">http://www.cirosantilli.com/elf-hello-world/</a></p>

<p>Alright, so now let's get a bit more accustomed with what ELF are about.</p></li>
<li><p>Weaponization<br />
<a href="https://medium.com/@dmxinajeansuit/elf-binary-mangling-part-1-concepts-e00cb1352301">https://medium.com/@dmxinajeansuit/elf-binary-mangling-part-1-concepts-e00cb1352301</a><br />
<a href="https://medium.com/@dmxinajeansuit/elf-binary-mangling-pt-2-golfin-7e5c82bb482c">https://medium.com/@dmxinajeansuit/elf-binary-mangling-pt-2-golfin-7e5c82bb482c</a><br />
<a href="https://medium.com/@dmxinajeansuit/elf-binary-mangling-part-3-weaponization-6e11971108b3">https://medium.com/@dmxinajeansuit/elf-binary-mangling-part-3-weaponization-6e11971108b3</a><br />
<a href="http://www.linuxsecurity.com/resource_files/documentation/virus-writing-HOWTO/_html/index.html">http://www.linuxsecurity.com/resource_files/documentation/virus-writing-HOWTO/_html/index.html</a></p>

<p>Those ones are easier to start with after diving into all the previous
content, it wraps things cleanly together. As far as the last link is
concerned, it's a bit of a hassle to read for me so far, not so well
ordered and explained, but probably a must to bookmark it for later.</p></li>
<li><p>Tools to manipulate ELFs
<a href="https://github.com/BR903/ELFkickers">https://github.com/BR903/ELFkickers</a></p>

<p>There's nothing better than hands on experience to learn what we've
been reading about. Other than using the usual tools such as readelf,
objdump, and all the hex editors available, this repo offers much more.</p></li>
<li><p>Linker<br />
<a href="http://s.eresi-project.org/inc/articles/elf-rtld.txt">http://s.eresi-project.org/inc/articles/elf-rtld.txt</a><br />
<a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/11/03/position-independent-code-pic-in-shared-libraries">https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/11/03/position-independent-code-pic-in-shared-libraries</a></p>

<p>What about libraries and linking in all that. A reminder of what we've
seen in other issues about GOT and PLT.</p></li>
<li><p>Some of the standard reference<br />
<a href="http://www.skyfree.org/linux/references/ELF_Format.pdf">http://www.skyfree.org/linux/references/ELF_Format.pdf</a><br />
<a href="http://refspecs.linuxbase.org/elf/elf.pdf">http://refspecs.linuxbase.org/elf/elf.pdf</a></p>

<p>To wrap this up, this another week of long reads. In continuation
with the dynamic linking articles series, we now tackle the body of
concern: ELF. Also review "Magic bytes" in 100 and "Executables &amp;
default program" in issue 77.  Maybe you should start with getting
used to manipulating simpler byte structures, such as what we did
before in issue 71 "Let's play with encoding and formats".</p></li>
<li><p>NO ram, just registers<br />
<a href="https://emsea.github.io/2017/12/31/register-buffer/">https://emsea.github.io/2017/12/31/register-buffer/</a></p>

<p>An interesting try at using available registers as a buffer. This
might be useless but pretty cool nevertheless.</p></li>
<li><p>Learn GRUB commands<br />
<a href="http://dcjtech.info/topic/grub-commands/">http://dcjtech.info/topic/grub-commands/</a><br />
<a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/76309/play-a-sound-before-or-after-grub-loads">https://askubuntu.com/questions/76309/play-a-sound-before-or-after-grub-loads</a><br />
<a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-password-protect-your-grub-menu/">https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-password-protect-your-grub-menu/</a></p>

<p>A quick and nice review of what the grub CLI offers. You probably
can bookmark that when you're in a pinch and need to check them or
maybe you just want to "play" a sound (that can't be muted), or add
a password to your booting process, or boot from a network image.</p></li>
<li><p>Awesome blog, xlib, ephemeral ports<br />
<a href="https://gavv.github.io/blog/ephemeral-port-reuse/">https://gavv.github.io/blog/ephemeral-port-reuse/</a><br />
<a href="https://gavv.github.io/blog/xlib-usage-examples/">https://gavv.github.io/blog/xlib-usage-examples/</a></p>

<p>Two enjoyable articles, a tricky question of reuse and race-conditions
over ephemeral ports, and the other a basic Xlib tutorial.</p></li>
<li><p>HTTP2 and X509<br />
<a href="https://http2-explained.haxx.se/content/en/">https://http2-explained.haxx.se/content/en/</a><br />
<a href="https://http3-explained.haxx.se/en/">https://http3-explained.haxx.se/en/</a><br />
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.04959.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.04959.pdf</a></p>

<p>Two quick books by Daniel Stenberg, the author of cURL, on HTTP2 and
HTTP3 and what has been attempted the last few years to speed up the
web. The last link is your weekly dose of crypto, a study of common
crypto libraries and how they handle X509 parsing. OpenSSL might be
written by monkeys as vermaden mentioned but it's still doing fine. As
far as I'm concerned I've dealt my good share with BouncyCastle,
and it's not that bad as far as the programming side goes.</p></li>

<h2>Unix</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>The classic, the beautiful<br />
<a href="http://www.lemis.com/grog/Documentation/Lions/book.pdf">http://www.lemis.com/grog/Documentation/Lions/book.pdf</a><br />
<a href="http://warsus.github.io/lions-/">http://warsus.github.io/lions-/</a><br />
<a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brewer/cs262/UNIX-annotated.pdf">https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brewer/cs262/UNIX-annotated.pdf</a></p>

<p>The original papers with additional commentaries to help you read
through them. As time goes by we're more impressed by how it's
a breeze to read through such fundamental building blocks to the
current ecosystem. The second link is fun because you have the source
attached on the window on the right, though it's missing the name
of the files/sheets. This is quite a big reading so take your time,
I'm not done myself.</p></li>
<li><p>Exception handling in tricky code<br />
<a href="https://binarydebt.wordpress.com/2018/11/16/try-catch-in-linux-kernel/">https://binarydebt.wordpress.com/2018/11/16/try-catch-in-linux-kernel/</a><br />
<a href="https://medium.com/@lduck11007/operating-systems-development-for-dummies-3d4d786e8ac">https://medium.com/@lduck11007/operating-systems-development-for-dummies-3d4d786e8ac</a></p>

<p>An explanation of the macros used within the Linux kernel to catch
faulty code with an extra article about building an OS from scratch.</p></li>
<li><p>Network drivers in Rust<br />
<a href="https://www.net.in.tum.de/fileadmin/bibtex/publications/theses/2018-ixy-rust.pdf">https://www.net.in.tum.de/fileadmin/bibtex/publications/theses/2018-ixy-rust.pdf</a></p>

<p>Everything can be rewritten in rust, that's the spirit we've learned
from "How to for a Rust kernel" in 103. This fantastic and approachable
paper (at least in the beginning) doesn't only cover how to translate
a driver from C code to Rust but, as with the kernel one, gives a
tutorial on how network drivers and on Rust in general work.</p></li>
<li><p>Async IO<br />
<a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/06/03/async-io-on-linux--select--poll--and-epoll/">https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/06/03/async-io-on-linux--select--poll--and-epoll/</a><br />
<a href="http://aivarsk.github.io/2017/04/06/select/">http://aivarsk.github.io/2017/04/06/select/</a><br />
<a href="https://github.com/aivarsk/misc/tree/master/select">https://github.com/aivarsk/misc/tree/master/select</a></p>

<p>A revisit of a basic topic under a new angle. Be sure to review the "The
C10K problem" in 52 and  "c10k follow up and a bit about flamegraphs"
in 53</p></li>
<li><p>Keeping time and date (1)<br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone</a><br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Mean_Time">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Mean_Time</a><br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time</a><br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Time">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Time</a><br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time</a><br />
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/locale">https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/locale</a></p>

<p>Keeping track of time is important for the activities humans do. Old
mechanisms were based on the apparent sun position. However, appearances
can be misleading, the earth speed is uneven and the sun is rarely at
the highest point at noon. Not to mention that a day is not exactly 24h
(we'll see the leap seconds in another issue)<br />
Improvement in worldwide communication and travel required
parties/entities to agree in a mutually comprehensible time
reference/standard.<br />
But time differs locally and so a synchronization mechanism needed to be
adopted world wide, even if it differed from sun time. Many standards
have been tried. The concept of time zones was put in place, an offset
from the standard time, but had to be flexible depending on the people and
especially countries and their economies. This is what UTC is about.<br />
Most timezones are whole number of hours but a few of them are offset
by 30 or 45min. Then to make it more complex, daylight saving time
(DST) appeared for weird economic reasons. Which these days are being
reconsidered in the EU (see "TIMEZONEs" in issue 101).<br />
A nice start to the topic would be to know how we write time, the
formatting. This is where the concept of locale on Unix comes in. The
<code>$LC_TIME</code> where you specify one of the well known format you want to
use for time.<br />
For the next issue more questions arises: What is time exactly, a unit,
how is it measured in computers and electronic devices these days,
especially on Unix? What about errors, drifts? How do we specify
the base standard time and our offset from it on Unix. And much more
to come.</p></li>
<li><p>Bird eye over pulseaudio internals<br />
<a href="https://gavv.github.io/blog/pulseaudio-under-the-hood/">https://gavv.github.io/blog/pulseaudio-under-the-hood/</a></p>

<p>Big projects, big planning and engineering, you need at least to have
worked with one of those in your life as a programmer. Pulseaudio
creates a lot of flamewars on the internet but it's still a nice
humbling piece of engineering. This is quite a long read, so prepare
yourself. It has everything, from the overview, to objects used within
the code, to complex examples and applications.</p></li>
<li><p>Docker Internals<br />
<a href="http://docker-saigon.github.io/post/Docker-Internals/">http://docker-saigon.github.io/post/Docker-Internals/</a></p>

<p>Another dive into a deep topic, similar to "Talking about fan base"
of 92, "Containers management" of 91, "Contain and protect" 76,
"Contain and protect" of 104, "Containers from scratch" of 51.</p></li>
<li><p>Font rendering<br />
<a href="http://dcjtech.info/topic/fonts-gui-and-x11/">http://dcjtech.info/topic/fonts-gui-and-x11/</a><br />
<a href="https://keithp.com/~keithp/render/Xft.tutorial">https://keithp.com/~keithp/render/Xft.tutorial</a><br />
<a href="https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.7/doc/xorg-docs/fonts/fonts.html#More_about_core_fonts">https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.7/doc/xorg-docs/fonts/fonts.html#More_about_core_fonts</a><br />
<a href="https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.7/doc/xorg-docs/xlfd/xlfd.txt">https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.7/doc/xorg-docs/xlfd/xlfd.txt</a></p>

<p>Another exploration into the world of fonts
on Unix, see "More on typography" in 63, <a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2017/06/04/fonts-on-unix.html">fonts on
Unix</a>,
and "Xft but for xcb" in 91. The first article is a review of the stack
we've already encountered, the second one goes over the Xft library
design and usage, the last ones are a bit more explanation about the
core fonts XLFD format so that you can compare it with the fancier Xft
matching features (which is fontconfig matching actually). I highly
recommend them to anyone interested in fonts and that want to follow
up on what we've shared before.</p></li>
<li><p>Building and interpreting<br />
<a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#url-parsing">https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#url-parsing</a><br />
<a href="http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/strings.html">http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/strings.html</a></p>

<p>You might think it's straight forward to parse URLs but it's not,
have a look. And the representation of the strings themselves is not as
easy either. We also talked about this in the article "How to implement
strings" of "Programming tricks and knowledge" of issue 100.</p></li>

<li><p>A war of names<br />
<a href="https://virtuallyfun.com/wordpress/2018/11/26/why-bsd-os-is-the-best-candidate-for-being-the-only-tested-legally-open-unix/">https://virtuallyfun.com/wordpress/2018/11/26/why-bsd-os-is-the-best-candidate-for-being-the-only-tested-legally-open-unix/</a></p>

<p>A review of the legality surrounding the UNIX name and which part of
which UNIX system is open sourced, to which degree and what manner. This
is probably the first article with as many German words as this one
that I read, it's fun.</p></li>
<li><p>Shared lib how to<br />
<a href="https://www.akkadia.org/drepper/dsohowto.pdf">https://www.akkadia.org/drepper/dsohowto.pdf</a></p>

<p>This is the research paper I was talking about last week (103) in "ELF
symbol resolution". As with anything written by Drepper, it's heavy
content and emphasizes on things to do so that code is optimized by
the compiler and when running. Be sure to read last week entry because
you'll need it to understand this one.</p></li>
<li><p>Terminal block mode<br />
<a href="ftp://ftp.invisible-island.net/shuford/terminal/block_mode_news.txt">ftp://ftp.invisible-island.net/shuford/terminal/block_mode_news.txt</a></p>

<p>I got reminded of this last week during our conversation on the forums
about future interfaces. Maybe we'll got back to terminals that update
per block depending on form filling, just like what we have today with
web APIs.</p></li>
<li><p>Foundations and groups<br />
<a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/the-linux-foundation/2018/11/the-linux-foundation-and-risc-v-foundation-announce-joint-collaboration-to-enable-a-new-era-of-open-architecture/">https://www.linuxfoundation.org/the-linux-foundation/2018/11/the-linux-foundation-and-risc-v-foundation-announce-joint-collaboration-to-enable-a-new-era-of-open-architecture/</a></p>

<p>A new hardware mixing with software alliance has formed. Focused on
RTOS that may be better supported on Linux in the future.</p></li>
<li><p>What's in a userland<br />
<a href="https://tilde.town/~elly/userland.txt">https://tilde.town/~elly/userland.txt</a></p>

<p>A straight forward intro to the thinking that goes into building
a user-space on Unix, from init to useful processes and putting it
together.</p></li>
<li><p>Contain and protect<br />
<a href="https://www.netmeister.org/blog/restricting-processes.html">https://www.netmeister.org/blog/restricting-processes.html</a></p>

<p>A deep dive into all the techniques used on Unix to containerize,
restrict, protect processes.</p></li>
<li><p>Scripting<br />
<a href="https://blog.dalanmiller.com/2018/12/02/easily-removing-all-your-files-from-flickr/">https://blog.dalanmiller.com/2018/12/02/easily-removing-all-your-files-from-flickr/</a></p>

<p>I had no idea flickr was still a service. This post is another instance
of replacing a paid service with another one and use a script to help
you do that.</p></li>
<li><p>Makefile best practices<br />
<a href="https://danyspin97.org/blog/makefiles-best-practices/">https://danyspin97.org/blog/makefiles-best-practices/</a></p>

<p>Another article about make best practices, see "Make" in issue 66 and
"Makefiles, Ohoh those Makefiles" of issue 38. This one covers basic
things such as variable assignment for specific parts of the Makefile,
pkg-config to find libs, and more.</p></li>
<li><p>vi and vim<br />
<a href="https://vimways.org/2018/">https://vimways.org/2018/</a><br />
<a href="https://sanctum.geek.nz/arabesque/vim-koans/">https://sanctum.geek.nz/arabesque/vim-koans/</a><br />
<a href="https://vfoley.xyz/vi/">https://vfoley.xyz/vi/</a><br />
<a href="https://www.qemu-advent-calendar.org/2018/">https://www.qemu-advent-calendar.org/2018/</a></p>

<p>With the third article from our friend tejr this ought to be an
interesting advent calendar, a month of vi and vim tips. Lots of fun
articles so far! Adding along the way the beautiful vim koans of tejr
and another opinion piece about vi. There's also a qemu advent calendar
now, checkt it out too.</p></li>
<li><p>Architectures and portability<br />
<a href="https://begriffs.com/posts/2018-11-15-c-portability.html">https://begriffs.com/posts/2018-11-15-c-portability.html</a></p>

<p>A reminder of "Computers without binaries"in 79 and all the C related
articles.</p></li>
<li><p>Linux on MacBook<br />
<a href="https://int3ractive.com/2018/09/make-the-best-of-MacBook-touchpad-on-Ubuntu.html">https://int3ractive.com/2018/09/make-the-best-of-MacBook-touchpad-on-Ubuntu.html</a></p>

<p>And this one deals with the touchpad. One idea I could take from this
post is to disable the touchpad while typing. Those are all pretty
hard to configure and don't come out of the box, maybe in the future
distributions can focus on making this easier.</p></li>
<li><p>NFS debug story<br />
<a href="https://about.gitlab.com/2018/11/14/how-we-spent-two-weeks-hunting-an-nfs-bug/">https://about.gitlab.com/2018/11/14/how-we-spent-two-weeks-hunting-an-nfs-bug/</a></p>

<p>As with other investigative stories in this newsletter we're so
captivated by the story and the action, those are the movies of
our world.</p></li>
<li><p>Another newsletter<br />
<a href="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/2018/12/01/valuable-news-2018-12-01/">https://vermaden.wordpress.com/2018/12/01/valuable-news-2018-12-01/</a></p>

<p>As you might have noticed we've linked vermaden's blog more than
once in this newsletter, there's great content in there. On it the
author also pushes more or less weekly/bi-weekly news/updates similar
to this newsletter. You should check it out. I've contacted vermaden
to see if it would be interesting to add a column in the newsletter
with his/her content also. This is what we'll try out from now on. As
you will notice there's a new section inserted here with links that
will be as new for you as they'll be for me. Vermaden Valuable news
is usually composed of Unix news&amp;updates, some hardware related news,
and a life&amp;other section similar to the "Random" section. Let's hope
you enjoy the Unix love. This week we have a lot of links about BSD
desktops, lots of new releases, ext4 fs on FreeBSD, bringing back old
Unix to life (you can even download the image), and much more. We also
brought back Xero's ricing tips section.</p></li>

<h2>Xero's Weekly Ricing Tips</h2>

<p>zathura is a vi{m,} like pdf and comicbook viewer.</p>

<p>besides having vi like bindings and a minimal ui, zathura is
extremely "riceable" and has a awesome feature called "recolor".
when set to true, you can define custom colors for bg and fg of
textual documents, but it also sets images to greyscale and tints
them in matching inverted hues. <code>:set recolor</code> is a toggle command,
so if your set it to run by default in your ~/.config/zathura/zathurarc
file, manually calling it from the ui will disable the feature.</p>

<p>here's my config for reference:
https://github.com/xero/dotfiles/blob/master/zathura/.config/zathura/zathurarc</p>

<p>cite:</p>

<p>The first link I've stolen from vermaden's "valuable news" and went
on a spree of related ideas. We live in a society/world that loves
to find clear causes to things, see "Development and learning" in 93,
especially when it comes to finding out if we're doomed/fated/determined
for a path. We want to find heroes and villains, distinctions and no
ambiguities. In those 4 articles this is the topic that comes across.</p></li>
<li><p>Regulatory capture<br />
<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regulatory-capture.asp">https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regulatory-capture.asp</a></p>

<p>Yet again a topic that follows a train of thoughts from earlier issues,
see "The Shirky principle" in 72 and the thought section of issue of
issue 99.</p></li>
<li><p>Web engines<br />
<a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/12/06/microsoft-edge-making-the-web-better-through-more-open-source-collaboration/">https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/12/06/microsoft-edge-making-the-web-better-through-more-open-source-collaboration/</a></p>

<p>I'll just leave this here, you can have the conversation you want
about it.</p></li>

<a href="https://github.com/myfreeweb/capsicumizer">https://github.com/myfreeweb/capsicumizer</a></p>

<p>I love it when tools like this come out. While we could be satisfied
with the default, usually not so user friendly, proof of concept the
original developers have come up with, it's awesome when the community
builds upon the starting block to create what they need from them.</p></li>
<li><p>ELF symbol resolution<br />
<a href="https://0x00sec.org/t/linux-internals-dynamic-linking-wizardry/1082">https://0x00sec.org/t/linux-internals-dynamic-linking-wizardry/1082</a><br />

<p>We've talked a lot about memory allocation, garbage collection, how
to write your own malloc ("In memory layout and Go" in issue 96,
"sbrk and malloc" in issue 53, "Malloc source" in 42, "Pointers,
pointers, and pointers" in 25), linking parameters ("LD.SO" in issue
54), the heap (see "Heap, malloc, glibc" in issue 85), the ELF format
("In-memory-only ELF execution" in issue 69, "Tiny ELF" in issue 47,
"The world most prominent virus has erased all the source code" in
issue 52, "Diving into and ELF" in issue 44, and more) and whatnot in
this newsletter, this is a continuation of the thought process. I've
got an extensive PDF for next week also, let's hope I can finish it to put it in
the next issue.</p></li>
<li><p>How to for a Rust kernel<br />
<a href="https://dominuscarnufex.github.io/cours/rs-kernel/en.html">https://dominuscarnufex.github.io/cours/rs-kernel/en.html</a></p>

<p>A complementary on "For all those people trying to rewrite a kernel"
of issue 96. This is a tutorial on both kernel system calls and rust
programming at the same time.</p></li>
<li><p>Data structures in the Linux VFS<br />
<a href="https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/lk/lk-8.html">https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/lk/lk-8.html</a></p>

<p>More and more on the VFS internals, continuation of "VFS, proc and
root filesystems" in 58, and "VFS in more details" of 62, and certainly
the podcast about "Data storage on Unix".</p></li>
<li><p>Fuzzing (continue)<br />

<p>This one is quite old compared to the other links I've shared about
fuzzing in the newsletter before but I waited on it to be a full fledge
popular topic. The article itself is a smooth introduction to fuzzing.</p></li>
<li><p>Big Opinions<br />

<p>If you carry with you absolutes on the internet you'll certainly
bring about discussions and arguments. "Every system is built from
a DSL designed by the programmers to describe that system. The
art of programming is, and has always been, the art of language
design. Robert Martin". Having a lot of quotes in a piece and is a
mark of an opinionated piece.</p></li>
<li><p>Open source and culture<br />

<p>Yet another instance of big opinions, this one I found quite
interesting to read and it's written by a nice fellow you probably
know. A follow up type of link for a sort of new series of ideas, see
"Open internet/source/culture and the future of this all" in 101 and
"A year of big acquisitions, big changes in priorities" from week 99.</p></li>
<li><p>Praising truth<br />

<p>Click-baity title but a pretty decent discussion by RMS on the Taler
system and how it compares with cryptocurrencies. This is in contrast
with the previous link, OSS vs FOSS.</p></li>
<li><p>More Emacs<br />
<a href="https://ambrevar.xyz/emacs-everywhere/">https://ambrevar.xyz/emacs-everywhere/</a></p>

<p>We've shared that blog before in "Shells and pipelines" of issue 75. In
this one we're being sold the idea of having emacs for everything with
only benefits.</p></li>

<p>A fun discussion I haven't heard about before that xero shared this
week about the famous Unix wizard poster.</p></li>

<p>But a good one, not an annoying listicle type. It gets 2M hits a
month on the blog and I've just discovered it. The second post is
also related to organizing yourself, the usual work-life balance,
a quite popular topic on technology news website. It reminded me
of the discussion we had on the forums about <a href="https://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=2070">Scientifically Proven
Digital Attention Helpers</a>,
things such as knowing the times in the day when you are more focused,
finding what works when guiding yourself towards an intent, what keeps
you focus or reminds you of what you need to do (environment or not),
splitting big tasks into smaller achievable ones to be able to track
them, going with the intent rather than a goal, etc.. See also "Time
management and management in general" of issue 98. While also ending
on a good note about the histrionic busy: see "Over-Productive" in 78,
"Production" in 66, and "The busy trap" in 32.</p></li>

<p>Also, yet again, a recurrent talk in this newsletter: fonts. This
episode covers custom typeface, why companies do it, should they
continue doing it, and if you should you pay attention.</p></li>

<h2>Thoughts</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Judgment is but a mirror that reflects the insecurities of the person
  who’s doing the judging.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpBC_jyg-go">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpBC_jyg-go</a></p>

<p>Some people live in a world where there are haters and lovers, people
that get you and others that don't, everyone judging each others,
scaling and measuring their behaviors, inspecting if everyone moves in
their plastic manner, pantomime, and making sure they never diverge
from their cookie-cutter molds otherwise we'd have to re-invent how we
perceive them. It's a world where one move means everything, where you
can't make mistakes.<br />
The thing is this only exists when we are teenagers full of hormones
living the school days life (or if you're a politician). Real life is
much more complex, so get over it.</p>

<h2>Unix</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Unikernels<br />
<a href="http://250bpm.com/blog:138">http://250bpm.com/blog:138</a></p>

<p>Unikernels are getting more popular in the world of
containerization. Other discussions about kernel talks in the newsletter
such as the classic "Monolithic vs micro" from 37 and "Not really unix
but close and soon will be" in 41 come to mind.</p></li>
<li><p>Linux Redhat and kernels<br />
<a href="https://next.redhat.com/2018/11/14/ukl-a-unikernel-based-on-linux/">https://next.redhat.com/2018/11/14/ukl-a-unikernel-based-on-linux/</a><br />
<a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/powering-its-future-while-preserving-present-introducing-red-hat-enterprise-linux-8-beta">https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/powering-its-future-while-preserving-present-introducing-red-hat-enterprise-linux-8-beta</a></p>

<p>While being corporate-ish Redhat is still one of the front face,
along with Oracle and others, to Unix-like operating systems. That
first link brings hope to the first entry of this newsletter.</p></li>
<li><p>Safe bash<br />
<a href="https://vaneyckt.io/posts/safer_bash_scripts_with_set_euxo_pipefail/">https://vaneyckt.io/posts/safer_bash_scripts_with_set_euxo_pipefail/</a></p>

<p>Another topic that keeps showing up, see "POSIX shell and no bashism"
in 93, "A new shell, why?" in 87, "One liners again..." in 79, "Shells
and pipelines" in 75, "Using bash not only for small scripts" in 64,
"Bash and shells" in 57, "Bash the bash for bash the bash" in 23, and
"Expansion &amp; Globs" in 17. That amount of articles on bash and shell
tricks in general is an example of how tricky it is to use them safely.</p></li>
<li><p>Gnome history<br />
<a href="https://www.bassi.io/articles/2018/10/25/the-history-of-gnome/">https://www.bassi.io/articles/2018/10/25/the-history-of-gnome/</a><br />
<a href="https://www.bassi.io/category/history/podcast.xml">https://www.bassi.io/category/history/podcast.xml</a></p>

<p>I'll subscribe to this and listen to it during the week, I have a huge
podcast list. The first episode sounds captivating. This should add
some spices to all the recent news such as the drop of KDE in RedHat
in favor of Gnome support, the shell extension and themes discussion,
the hackathons follow up, and much more.</p></li>
<li><p>Designing a font<br />
<a href="https://www.cambus.net/spleen-monospaced-bitmap-fonts/">https://www.cambus.net/spleen-monospaced-bitmap-fonts/</a></p>

<p>Creating a font that looks nice in all situations is hard, and it's even
harder when it's a bitmap font. Also, be sure to disable antialiasing,
subpixel rendering, and hinting to keep the crispiness of the bitmaps.</p></li>

<li><p>Celebrating Unix<br />
<a href="https://unix50.org/">https://unix50.org/</a></p>

<p>The anniversary was quite a while ago in internet time but we're still

<li><p>GCC arguments<br />

<p>Should you care about the people that are relying on unintended
behaviours to build software using your libraries. What about when you
break/fix this behaviour. We've seen that a bit recently in "OpenBSD
doas update and virt" of issue 99.</p></li>
<li><p>D'you have a problem?<br />
<a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/a3mgxb/the-internet-has-a-huge-cc-problem-and-developers-dont-want-to-deal-with-it">https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/a3mgxb/the-internet-has-a-huge-cc-problem-and-developers-dont-want-to-deal-with-it</a></p>

<p>A title that shouts "CLICK ME" with an article that is more or less
fair. In my opinion switching from one language to another is only
moving the problem from one space to another space, a whole lot of
new security issues will arise. What do you think?</p></li>
<li><p>Gaming on FreeBSD<br />
<a href="https://oshogbo.vexillium.org/blog/58/">https://oshogbo.vexillium.org/blog/58/</a></p>

<p>We've done gaming on Linux ("Missing games?" in 50 and "Free games"
in 10) and recently gaming on OpenBSD ("Extra" in issue 90), this time
we're doing gaming on FreeBSD.</p></li>

<p>I don't think I've read a more politically loaded articles this
year, I'm not sure why but this is not a trend I'm found of and from
the discussions on the forums and irc I know a lot agree that this
is getting tiresome. Trying to paint a narrative over whatever is
happening, especially a narrative that only applies in certain parts
of the world. Keep away with your anti or pro capitalism talk from the
60s and let us enjoy the tech instead. Especially when it comes to the
second article and the author nagging about Google being a corporate
evil because their own product features are not supported in their
pdf reader.</p></li>

<p>Another revisit of the topic of "the slow feel", this one feels
complete. Somehow related to "Learning From Terminals to Design the
Future of User Interfaces" in issue 22, "Latency, second round" in 33,
and "This is why NES games are awesome" in issue 28.</p></li>

<p>Meditation, learning psychology, taking the time to teach ourselves
about cognitive biases, controlling our day to day intents and attention,
leading our future changes and directions. All those are things that are
possible and we live in the best time to try them. As much as a cliché
as this is I still thought of putting this as the thought of the week.</p>

wish I could live in my own timezone like that author, maybe my wish
would come true using that trick. It's also my first time encountering
the utility <code>zic</code>. As a bonus, because we've saved some hours with
our custom timezone, we'll get a wonderful discussion about mtime,
the modification timestamp set in the inode (see <code>stat(1)</code>). In my

  <p>If you can't tell me what you'd like to happen it means you don't have
  a problem yet. It's simply nagging. A problem exist only if there's a
  difference between what is effectively happening and what you'd like
  to happen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Going along with the last link of the random section, a thought that's
been playing in my head for some time now is to "Make explicit what is
implicit". We often assume wrongly that some things should go unsaid
but it's always better to be clear about what we have understood, what
we expect, what we would wish would be the best possible outcome, that's
the only good way to avoid mistakes and misunderstandings. Also we need
to add that this does not only apply to problematic scenarios but to any
others, if we like something we should be explicit about what exactly
what done right and what exactly we liked, this way everyone progresses.</p>

<p>Have a wonderful week everyone.</p>

<p>Media craze, maybe. I just don't think there need to be such silly
reason behind the IBM acquisition, putting KDE in the loop along with
conspiracy thinking. Gnome is getting lots of news as of lately also,

<p>"A new shell, why?" in 87 depicts why you should keep your hopes down
but it's still fun to try out different things. It's very friendly to
use, sorts of reminds me of fish. One annoying thing I noticed is that
it doesn't respect <code>ctrl-l</code> to clear the screen but goes into history
mode instead though it can be overridden. The last link is in the same
mindset, a new tool to build pipelines.</p></li>

<h2>Unix</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>A year of big acquisitions, big changes in priorities<br />

<p>I sort of avoided putting business-y articles in this newsletter
but I guess it's good to discuss the big acquisitions of this year,
this clearly shows the direction that the tech world is taking and is
putting its bets on.</p></li>
<li><p>Linux hidpi<br />
<a href="https://vincent.bernat.ch/en/blog/2018-4k-hidpi-dual-screen-linux">https://vincent.bernat.ch/en/blog/2018-4k-hidpi-dual-screen-linux</a></p>

<p>It's one of the thing I keep hearing about from people using Linux,
the reviews are harsh but fair. I guess we should keep our expectations
low and be surprised when something better happens.</p></li>
<li><p>Another week of systemd nags<br />
<a href="https://blog.erratasec.com/2018/10/systemd-is-bad-parsing-and-should-feel.html">https://blog.erratasec.com/2018/10/systemd-is-bad-parsing-and-should-feel.html</a><br />
<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/systemd/+bug/1795921">https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/systemd/+bug/1795921</a></p>

<p>Hopefully it'll get patched soon, what can I say. I mean, I don't
agree at all that we shouldn't use at all whatever is layed out in
this article but there's a point.</p></li>
<li><p>Dependencies in services<br />
<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/InitDependencyUnclear">https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/InitDependencyUnclear</a></p>

<p>As usual from this blog it's great content, in this post we see some
very good thoughts about what sort of dependencies can exist between
services.</p></li>

<a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2014/10/27/ps/">https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2014/10/27/ps/</a></p>

<p>Also a blog we've seen before in this newsletter, in this episode
we'll discover yet another intricate and edge scenario about running
out of memory.</p></li>
<li><p>Cleaning the kernel<br />
<a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/internationalizing-kernel">https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/internationalizing-kernel</a><br />

<p>Internationalizing the kernel sounds like a really bad idea... I'm
not sure where and how anyone could think of this. However, removing
all variable length arrays, that's something that is fruitful.</p></li>

<p>The first link reminded me of the binfmt on Linux, check "Executables &amp;
default program" in issue 77. It is related to unveil changes. I kind
of like the conclusion "A thing which used to work stopped working, the
unintended result of what should have been a harmless change. Ordinarily
we’d call that a bug. Except this new behavior is actually what I
wanted all along. So could the bug be a bug fix?"</p></li>

<p>You probably don't need to read this but it's kind of well done and
I had no clue you could create a sort of PKI with ssh keys. See also
"SSH ascii art" in 74, "You wouldn't believe what this ssh can do"
in 72, "OpenSSH escape sequences" in 46, and much more content related
to ssh and ssh keys.</p></li>
<li><p>Learning from rsync<br />
<a href="https://blog.plover.com/prog/switch-case-optimization.html">https://blog.plover.com/prog/switch-case-optimization.html</a></p>

<p>A case of switch case optimization. One of those nifty tricks that you
can show off to your coworkers, and maybe in future days somebody will
wonder how the hek it works.</p></li>
<li><p>Ubuntu, DE, and other shells<br />

first link reminds us of the days of discovery and the second one is an
example on how nowadays connecting everyone through the web is easier.</p></li>

<p>The first two are closely related to "About memory" in 58, "A summary"
in 64, and "CPU optimizations" in 73, lots of discussion about compiler
optimizations, specifically targeted at arm cpu. I'm quite a fan of the
graphical representation and code example of the improvements, this
is radically different than Ulrich's old paper. As for DragonflyBSD,
that page was without a doubt popular and has finally been updated
with some newer statistics of 2018 using the brand new "Threadripper"
everyone has been spamming so much about in all the tech media (You
gotta admit it's good PR). See for yourself if the BSD known for using
SMP the best stays true to its name on the 64 threads monster CPU.</p></li>

<p>The start of a series of post about the difference between Arcan and
Xorg, we talked a bit about Arcan before in "GUI" in 77 and "Awk for
multimedia" in 44. This articles brings a lot of X related topics such
as rendering, fonts, input management, clipboard (see "X11 Clipboard"
in 9), etc..</p></li>

<p>There's a bit of hype about GC these days, be it java 11 ZGC (see
"Solaris 11.4 SRU and Java 11, everything Oracle" in 94), or Go GC (see
"In memory layout and Go" in 96 and "For all those people trying to
rewrite a kernel" in the same issue), or Mozilla Firefox JS updates
on their GC, or Rust gc, or whatever, all are thriving for better
memory footprint.</p></li>

<h2>Thoughts</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>"There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is
  to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and
  the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious
  deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult." ― C. A. R. Hoare</p>

  <p>"At first I hoped that such a technically unsound project would collapse
  but I soon realized it was doomed to success. Almost anything in software
  can be implemented, sold, and even used given enough determination. There
  is nothing a mere scientist can say that will stand against the flood
  of a hundred million dollars. But there is one quality that cannot be
  purchased in this way - and that is reliability. The price of reliability
  is the pursuit of the utmost simplicity. It is a price which the very
  rich find most hard to pay." ― C.A.R. Hoare</p>

<h2>Unix</h2>

<a href="https://vincent.bernat.ch/en/blog/2017-write-own-terminal">https://vincent.bernat.ch/en/blog/2017-write-own-terminal</a></p>

<p>It's not really a terminal from scratch but this article shows well
how you can build upon the VTE lib to create something.</p></li>
<li><p>FreeBSD amd64 syscalls<br />
<a href="https://cryptoden.pw/downloads/Dive_into_syscall_handling_on_freeBSD_AMD64.txt">https://cryptoden.pw/downloads/Dive_into_syscall_handling_on_freeBSD_AMD64.txt</a></p>

<p>An advanced paper (written in the typical style of security researchers
aka not-very-readable) about FreeBSD system calls. Sadly, unlike
everything else in most of the newsletter even weird esoteric research,
I couldn't finish the paper as it was too dense (or maybe it's me).</p></li>
<li><p>What you get from reading code instead of books<br />
<a href="https://nanxiao.me/en/the-byproducts-of-reading-openbsd-netcat-code/">https://nanxiao.me/en/the-byproducts-of-reading-openbsd-netcat-code/</a></p>

<p>Just a quick review by the author on what was learned/found from
reading the netcat OpenBSD code.</p></li>
<li><p>OpenBSD on the desktop<br />
<a href="https://blog.gsora.xyz/openbsd-on-the-desktop-some-thoughts/">https://blog.gsora.xyz/openbsd-on-the-desktop-some-thoughts/</a></p>

<p>Also a thought article with points on what the author liked or not about
the OpenBSD user experience. Sort of related to all the entries that
touch the topic of desktop and UX such as "Themes and the past" in 87,
"BSD on desktop and more GUI stuffs" in 80, "BSD on desktop and laptop"
in 72.</p></li>
<li><p>Some lwn with Linux inspired by BSDs<br />

<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/767137/">https://lwn.net/Articles/767137/</a></p>

<p>The first article is about getting more idle (power wise too)
in the idle state by stopping the kernel tick if it seems like a
good idea. Second one is about the freedesktop group (fd.o) having
a discussion about their past, current, and future and direction. I
added after that one a link to the gnome redesigns which they've been
working on, see "Hackathon and secure chats" in 76. The last article
is about how to be inspired by OpenBSD's unveil which we mentioned
multiple times in this newsletter.</p></li>

<p>Lots of nostalgia in this article, but we've moved on. Is is rosy
retrospection or is it not. The author dreads these new days as if
they lack social network interaction... I'm not sure about that,
more like there's too much of it, or maybe it's another kind of
interaction. What's your take on that topic? A reminder of "Will
Geocities websites make a comeback?" in 56.</p></li>

article in the series is somehow related to the <a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2017/11/05/unix-filesystem.html">data storage on

<p>Lots of people praise Apple for being full of intent on security and
privacy, some agree on that stance, some say it's only marketing. In
this blog post there's a list of steps that could easily be taken by
any non-technical user to ensure a bit of security. Somewhat related to
"The Shirky principle" in 72 and "Differential privacy" 47. The last
link is not really connected to the first one but it's an issue that
I've encountered this week and found interesting.</p></li>

about the horrible long term effects it has on us that I might have
started to be biased about what I read about the topic. This fun
article, along with the fascinating research paper, go over to the
opposite side, the side where stress is a helper depending on how you
use it and perceive it, a part of growth and human life.</p></li>

<h2>Unix</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>In memory layout and Go<br />
<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/GoProgramMemoryUse">https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/GoProgramMemoryUse</a><br />

<p>Going over the memory chunks allocated by Go. You must also check "Heap,
malloc, glibc" in issue 85 for an idea of the layout of the heap and
how it's similar to Go structure. The second link is an extra because
it has been covered multiple times before in a lot of other entries
already such as "sbrk and malloc" in 53.</p></li>
<li><p>For all those people trying to rewrite a kernel<br />
<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi18/presentation/cutler">https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi18/presentation/cutler</a></p>

<p>Whatever your preferred high level language this paper goes into the
details, motivations, practicalities of writing a kernel with it. It
has a big emphasis on memory/heap usage, things such as OOM and more.</p></li>
<li><p>CLI from the perspective of the "hype" industry<br />

<p>Pale, even cringy and opposite, in comparison with "Yet again a Unix
CLI discussion" of 77 and all the other Unix philosophy design talks
such as the popular "The Art of Unix Programming" by ESR, but it still
deserves a small mention.</p></li>

<h2>Unix</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Yet another OpenBSD installation tuto<br />
<a href="https://bsdboy.ml/posts/installing-hugo-and-hosting-website/">https://bsdboy.ml/posts/installing-hugo-and-hosting-website/</a></p>

<p>This seems like the trend of the moment, and a nice one at that,
blog posts about setting up any kind of services on OpenBSD machines.</p></li>
<li><p>Terminal madness (continue)<br />
<a href="http://xn--rpa.cc/essays/term">http://xn--rpa.cc/essays/term</a><br />
<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/zvawoa/on_terminal_control">https://lobste.rs/s/zvawoa/on_terminal_control</a></p>

<p>Not much to say about this one other than to refer to "Terminal
interface" from 92, "Alternative screen and the quirkiness of terminals"
in 86, "Terminal madness once more" in 82, and also that when I
started doing ascii arts with colors I was manually typing the color
escape codes and it was time-consuming. Maybe refer to the terminals
podcast found here <a href="https://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=2108">https://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=2108</a> or
<a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2017/06/04/terminals.html">https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2017/06/04/terminals.html</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Layering docker with Nix<br />
<a href="https://grahamc.com/blog/nix-and-layered-docker-images">https://grahamc.com/blog/nix-and-layered-docker-images</a></p>

<p>It's kind of hard for me to grasp this topic as I've not delve too
much into it but I grasp the overall concept and it seems really cool.</p></li>
<li><p>More on device mapping<br />
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGnFhmG8gT0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGnFhmG8gT0</a><br />
<a href="https://www.thegeekdiary.com/beginners-guide-to-device-mapper-dm-multipathing/">https://www.thegeekdiary.com/beginners-guide-to-device-mapper-dm-multipathing/</a><br />
<a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Device-mapper">https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Device-mapper</a></p>

<p>The first link is a presentation about the implementation
of device removal of a top layer in ZFS. The second in the
list is maybe not as low level as the ones from "Device
Mapper" in '77' but still very refreshing, for more review
on that topic you can check the podcast on <a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2017/11/05/unix-filesystem.html">data storage on
Unix</a>.
Thegeekdiary blog may sound clickbaity but I was surprised by the
quality of the content, time to add it to your list of places to follow
up. The last link is a wiki that goes over dmsetup, the command line
tool used to manipulate device mappers the internals of things such as
the raid and crypt implementations. There's also a list of other very
interesting device mapper implementation I had no clue existed. I'm
sure there are some people around that are fan of volume management
and fancy device mappers stacks.</p></li>
<li><p>Linux cache bug<br />

<p>A dive (deep) into the Linux VMA to find an overflow bug.</p></li>

<p>Maybe a bit related to "Let's play with encoding and formats" in
issue 71.</p></li>
<li><p>Auditing<br />
<a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/security_guide/chap-system_auditing">https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/security_guide/chap-system_auditing</a><br />
<a href="https://linux-audit.com/configuring-and-auditing-linux-systems-with-audit-daemon/">https://linux-audit.com/configuring-and-auditing-linux-systems-with-audit-daemon/</a></p>

<p>This week I was reminded of this tool, it sort of fit a
business/security case we need. For those who wants to learn more
about it those two links should get you started.</p></li>
<li><p>The never ending questions about C<br />
<a href="https://words.steveklabnik.com/should-you-learn-c-to-learn-how-the-computer-works">https://words.steveklabnik.com/should-you-learn-c-to-learn-how-the-computer-works</a></p>

<p>A decent and fair article on this topic that comes out a lot, see also
"Why C and not something else" in 89 and "More C, more C" in 78.</p></li>
<li><p>Paper vs screen<br />
<a href="https://www.ischool.utexas.edu/~adillon/Journals/Reading.htm">https://www.ischool.utexas.edu/~adillon/Journals/Reading.htm</a></p>

<p>I've read this research, which is a sort of meta-analysis, about a
year ago when doing a brainstorm on scientifically proven digital
attention helpers. I thought of sharing it again this week, as this
is a recurrent topic of discussion.</p></li>
<li><p>Software development management<br />

<p>The urban legend of the programmers who've automated their jobs. Maybe
also checkout "Useless jobs" in 74, and "Ludites or not" in 72.</p></li>

<li><p>The WWW is awesome (continue+)<br />
<a href="https://youtu.be/wSn7CJ0cNZ4">https://youtu.be/wSn7CJ0cNZ4</a></p>

<p>Last weekend I had this discussion with a friend about this series
I ran in this newsletter about the WWW awesomeness of niche found in
there and why I was doing that. The sort of refreshment in the face
of the never ending list of articles and debates about the online
click-economy, privacy, and attention span issues that I've discussed
so much in the state-of-the-web state-of-the-mind series. This link is
from this same friend, it's quite interesting and well researched as
are a lot of those sort of educational Youtube videos, maybe not as
niche as the other kinds of videos I've inserted in this newsletter
but still fun. This is entry is more of a reminder of the topic then
being about the content of the video. So, readers, if you stumble
upon things on the internet that makes you go "Waw, damn this is good"
then hit me up with it and I'll happily share it in the newsletter.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Thoughts</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Whatever your strengths are, they will likely lead straight into
  your weaknesses."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A quote from the "Twelve Natural Laws of Business", see
<a href="http://www.zingermanscommunity.com/2012/01/natural-law-10-whatever-your-strengths-are-they-will-likely-lead-straight-into-your-weaknesses/">http://www.zingermanscommunity.com/2012/01/natural-law-10-whatever-your-strengths-are-they-will-likely-lead-straight-into-your-weaknesses/</a>
for more info.<br />
What I have been reminded by this quote is actually the total opposite,
when someone is aware of their weakness it will often appear to others
as their most polished attribute.</p>

<h2>Unix</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>More OpenBSD networking<br />
<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/papers/asiabsdcon08-network.pdf">https://www.openbsd.org/papers/asiabsdcon08-network.pdf</a><br />
<a href="https://jonwillia.ms/2018/09/23/anycast-dns-openbsd">https://jonwillia.ms/2018/09/23/anycast-dns-openbsd</a></p>

<p>A well explained, quick, and approachable paper giving an overview
of OpenBSD network stack. This is my highly recommended read for the
week. This is followed by a guide to running anycast DNS on OpenBSD
in the world of homecooked community-based meshed network.</p></li>
<li><p>Ed, my old friend<br />
<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/EdNoLongerGoodEditor">https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/EdNoLongerGoodEditor</a></p>

<p>Remember "Just ed" in issue 40, yeah so nothing unexpected here, welcome
to another Unix rant about text editors, a toned down and fair version.</p></li>
<li><p>spawn() why isn't there something like that<br />
<a href="https://tavianator.com/spawn-of-satan/">https://tavianator.com/spawn-of-satan/</a></p>

<p>A sweet article going through the Unix way of starting new processes
via already running processes and a "meditation" on the upsides and
downsides of it.</p></li>
<li><p>dmesg<br />
<a href="https://ops.tips/blog/dmesg-under-the-hood/">https://ops.tips/blog/dmesg-under-the-hood/</a></p>

<p>In this post we explore how dmesg and the Linux ring buffer works.</p></li>
<li><p>Testing the GNU coreutils<br />
<a href="http://www.pixelbeat.org/docs/coreutils-testing.html">http://www.pixelbeat.org/docs/coreutils-testing.html</a></p>

<p>The whole logic behind the test suite used for the GNU coreutils, a
well designed test suite in my opinion. You can use the tips mentioned
in the article for your owns.</p></li>
<li><p>A marriage between package management and https<br />
<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/papers/eurobsdcon_2018_https.pdf">https://www.openbsd.org/papers/eurobsdcon_2018_https.pdf</a></p>

<p>The couple fight between pkg management and https, with a bit of a look
at the shiny new TLS1.3 and finally giving the coup-de-grace showing
how confidentiality here may not matter because it's not there so
we should rely on something else. Related to "Nagging about Debian"
in 63 and "APT and https" in 60.</p></li>
<li><p>Chrome and crypto<br />
<a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2018/09/23/why-im-leaving-chrome/">https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2018/09/23/why-im-leaving-chrome/</a><br />

<a href="http://blog.obligd.com/posts/everyday-crypto.html">http://blog.obligd.com/posts/everyday-crypto.html</a></p>

<p>Three links about the Chrome browser recent discussion and the last ones
about crypto and security in general. The PGP one is related to "Spirit
of the law" in 84, "Let's play with encoding and formats" in 71, "Why
we should use plain text emails" in 75, and "Don't use PGP? Why?" in 42.</p></li>
<li><p>Vnc and remote<br />

<a href="https://benjojo.co.uk">https://benjojo.co.uk</a></p>

<p>We kind of had a trend to create home pages similar to our window
managers, this person takes it further by running the entire OS
and discovering the security issues with it. This is close to "Run
everything on the web!" of 19 and "Emulators in JS" of 16.</p></li>
<li><p>Solaris 11.4 SRU and Java 11, everything Oracle<br />
<a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/solaris/announcing-oracle-solaris-114-sru1">https://blogs.oracle.com/solaris/announcing-oracle-solaris-114-sru1</a><br />

<p>SRU or Source Repository Update, Solaris is still getting cool updates
and support so far (see "Solaris is still alive" in 79), and with
Oracle position on Java 11 this will all develop ""interestingly"".</p></li>
<li><p>Swap on Linux<br />
<a href="https://opensource.com/article/18/9/swap-space-linux-systems">https://opensource.com/article/18/9/swap-space-linux-systems</a></p>

<p>"Arrows cycle symbol for failing faster", I have no clue why this
image was chosen in the article... This is a bit related to our usual
"data storage on Unix" type of article, while just grasping the tip
of the iceberg it's still a good tutorial article that explains most
of the content related to swapping.</p></li>

seemed like everywhere I went chess made an appearance. From a series I'm
watching with my significant other, to a podcast, to my coworker learning
some new moves. Though I haven't got to play this week, ironically, but
the concept that kept floating in my mind was the one found in this quote.</p>

<p>The newsletter is coming early this week because I'm taking some small
vacations, have fun everyone.</p>

<h2>Unix</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Terminal interface<br />
<a href="https://p.janouch.name/article-tui.html">https://p.janouch.name/article-tui.html</a></p>

<p>A work-in-progress article about the magic (mess) of terminals we've
been so fond of. See "Terminal madness once more" in 82 and what it
refers in its description, also "Alternative screen and the quirkiness
of terminals" in 86. We've shared a lot of content related to this.</p></li>
<li><p>Have you said magic<br />
<a href="https://rhelblog.redhat.com/2018/01/12/linux-and-the-enduring-magic-of-unix/">https://rhelblog.redhat.com/2018/01/12/linux-and-the-enduring-magic-of-unix/</a></p>

<p>The usual "what my journey has been" sort of article. This one differs
a bit so it's interesting to go through. Beware for those sensible
persons that get micro-aggression-post-traumatic-disorder from hearing
Linux and Unix in the same sentence.</p></li>
<li><p>We have to compare it with something<br />
<a href="http://blog.nullspace.io/batch.html">http://blog.nullspace.io/batch.html</a></p>

<p>Let me just quote this eloquent way to put things: "Bash: a language
that was neither designed, nor evolved. An adequate solution to a
problem that has since become orders of magnitude harder. As arcane
as it is useful, as dangerous as it is ubiquitous, Bash: the language
that asks how much we are willing to give up for convenience’s sake?".</p></li>
<li><p>Talking about fan base<br />
<a href="https://medium.com/s-c-a-l-e/how-containers-became-a-tech-darling-and-why-docker-became-their-poster-child-bfaf9ac87825">https://medium.com/s-c-a-l-e/how-containers-became-a-tech-darling-and-why-docker-became-their-poster-child-bfaf9ac87825</a></p>

<p>An interview with the old CTO of Joyent now head of tech at cloud system
at Ericsson about containers, how they came to be and why they took off.</p></li>
<li><p>Bad processes<br />
<a href="https://blog.xenproject.org/2018/08/01/killing-processes-that-dont-want-to-be-killed/">https://blog.xenproject.org/2018/08/01/killing-processes-that-dont-want-to-be-killed/</a></p>

<p>There's a subtle manner to do simple things the right way without
getting yourself in trouble. Here we explore killing a process,
especially when we want to have it containerized and not contaminate
all the system.</p></li>
<li><p>Oldies<br />
<a href="https://notes.technologists.com/notes/2017/03/08/lets-start-at-the-very-beginning-801-romp-rtpc-aix-versions/">https://notes.technologists.com/notes/2017/03/08/lets-start-at-the-very-beginning-801-romp-rtpc-aix-versions/</a></p>

<p>If you're into that sort of recollection of the past with all the
gritty details then you'll like this, otherwise it'll all sound like
some boring corporate story telling without value.</p></li>
<li><p>Multithreading, multiprocess, coroutine, asynchronous, parallel, NUMA &amp; SMP<br />
<a href="https://oshogbo.vexillium.org/blog/50/">https://oshogbo.vexillium.org/blog/50/</a></p>

<p>This article deals with writing code that doesn't lock or spin too
much or use mutex everytime we have to read or write something in a
multi-anything environment.</p></li>
<li><p>A Linux distro that is BBQ grilled<br />
<a href="https://killx.linuxbbq.org/">https://killx.linuxbbq.org/</a></p>

<p>Tired of having it grandma-easy with GUIs and binary installs then
this is for you.</p></li>
<li><p>System programming<br />
<a href="http://willcrichton.net/notes/systems-programming/">http://willcrichton.net/notes/systems-programming/</a></p>

<p>Another instance of pedantry related to name giving. A good definition
in my opinion is "programming to maintain the system so that other
applications can run better", close to the second definition in the
first quote of the article.</p></li>
<li><p>New OpenSSL release<br />
<a href="https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2018/09/11/release111/">https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2018/09/11/release111/</a></p>

<p>This one finally brings the TLS v1.3 support we've been talking about
for so long. This is the big feature of the release basically, enjoy
and don't forget to keep doing security updates.</p></li>

<h2>Thoughts</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>"does the tournament make sense as you keep going?"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why are we striving for what we are striving for. Does it make sense to
focus more on it or to stabilize, spread out, and balance efforts into
other things. To keep going on in the tournament we have to put more of
ourselves in it and so less into other things. Maybe this is a warped
up way of saying "rat race" maybe it's not, it depends on how deliberate
we are about our decisions.</p>

<p>Lots of projects and articles all with OpenBSD in mind as a
platform. You can replace your cloud system provider with nextcloud
and run it on OpenBSD. Or use 2FA with one of those external physical
token authentication device. Or you can wonder about the state of
security patching, from hardware to software (not really OpenBSD but
very interesting).</p></li>

<p>Custom URL schemes, what did the standards say about that,
check last week "The arch of the web" in issue 90. They're

<p>Those are some nice blog names "coding against chaos", "code
without rules", "codetastrophe", this shows how we perceive our
domain of expertise. From testing code, to forking, and ending with
building cross platform elf. I would've put every one of those
in a separate entry but I couldn't resist mentioning the blog
naming. The source for the last post can be found on Google code
<a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/codetastrophe/source/default/source">https://code.google.com/archive/p/codetastrophe/source/default/source</a>,

<a href="https://github.com/joukos/PaperTTY">https://github.com/joukos/PaperTTY</a></p>

<p>This week in awesome inventions we have TTY on e-paper/e-ink
displays. The coolness can be summarized with this sentence "Running
Nethack outside in the noon sun, powered directly by a solar panel,

<a href="https://p.janouch.name/article-xgb.html">https://p.janouch.name/article-xgb.html</a></p>

<p>I'm shamelessly plugging one of my own articles. This goes into how
to implement a font library, similar to how Xft works, using common
building blocks. If you're interested in how the font stack is put
together then this is for you. The second article is about thinking
on how to build a UI from scratch using X11, it discuses in more depth
about the components and libraries that are needed to plug everything
together. It's a great resource.</p></li>

<p>We all have our favorite colorscheme, our favorite way of displaying
text (see "Choosing the right typography" in issue 74), but when
it comes to showing it to different persons, especially during
presentations, there should be a standard pleasant way to do it. Kudos
to the author of this article for putting some light on this subject.</p></li>

some of the quirks of pulling prepackaged "official" builds, the
security implication on keeping packages within containers up to date,
and other things to know.</p></li>

  <p>"Are they smart? Do they get things done? Do I want to spend a lot
  of time around them?" - Sam Altman</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This week we have a quote related to work culture, more precisely
partnering up aka having coworkers or hiring. I've noted that quote when
the "How to Start a Startup" course at Standford in Fall 2014 came out
and have kept it in my mind since then. How do we know that the team is
holding well together. Some of the criteria are in that quote, what others
do you want to add? This can be your conversation starter for next week.</p>

<h2>Unix</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Dropbox is dropping support<br />
<a href="http://wittchen.io/2018/08/12/poor-mans-dropbox/">http://wittchen.io/2018/08/12/poor-mans-dropbox/</a></p>

<p>Well, not really true, they're reducing what they want to focus on,
namely what type of filesystem they will support. Read on to know
how the author builds a mini alternative to Dropbox. In my opinion it
would be better to sync the <code>~/Backup</code> directory instead of deleting
and copying everytime, deleting and copying is way too risky.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep the flame alive<br />
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlbQsKpq3Ak&amp;t=0s&amp;list=PL64C1C0401141D607&amp;index=2">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlbQsKpq3Ak&amp;t=0s&amp;list=PL64C1C0401141D607&amp;index=2</a><br />

<p>Learn from the past. The last link is a community where you are only
able to download if you share with them some abandonware, I'm adding
it in case someone is interested in those kinds of things.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow changing uid in range<br />

<p>As with anything related to setuid things quickly get confusing. We
shared "Setuid... again!" in 28, "Bash is secure" in 13, and "Oh so
confusing setuid" in 8. Review those content and continue reading
those two links.</p></li>
<li><p>Building a DE, what does it take?<br />
<a href="https://pythonfunblog.wordpress.com/2017/10/14/writing-a-desktop-environment-with-python/">https://pythonfunblog.wordpress.com/2017/10/14/writing-a-desktop-environment-with-python/</a><br />

<p>Window managers and desktop environments, how do they get build,
where to start, this is what this article tries to tackle. For more
on that topic see: "Window managers" in 64, and "Display servers and
graphic operations" in 73.</p></li>
<li><p>Why C and not something else<br />
<a href="https://mortoray.com/2012/06/11/whats-to-love-about-c/">https://mortoray.com/2012/06/11/whats-to-love-about-c/</a><br />
<a href="http://faehnri.ch/how-c-is-not-a-subset-of-cpp/">http://faehnri.ch/how-c-is-not-a-subset-of-cpp/</a></p>

<p>Everyone have their ways of justifying why they like what they like and
why they do what they do, that's what happens in the first post. It
goes over the reasons why C is still relevant. In the second one the
author clarifies why c++ is not c &amp; classes.</p></li>

<p>The type of pun is similar to the one in the video of "Retro gaming"
in issue 77. This one is more simple and sweet though.</p></li>
<li><p>Networking<br />
<a href="https://rhelblog.redhat.com/2015/09/29/pushing-the-limits-of-kernel-networking/">https://rhelblog.redhat.com/2015/09/29/pushing-the-limits-of-kernel-networking/</a><br />

<p>From configuring and understanding bottleneck in the kernel related to
networking performance, to a follow up on the anatomy of a Linux DNS
lookup series, to a video about current issues with the network stack
(using netmap for user-space networking).</p></li>
<li><p>The edge, what?<br />
<a href="https://arcentry.com/blog/what-the-f-is-the-edge/">https://arcentry.com/blog/what-the-f-is-the-edge/</a></p>

<p>In a world of "cloud computing" and hyper-hype over keywords an
ad-clicks, here's the new one that you need to attach yourself to:
the edge.</p></li>
<li><p>Another ACM issue<br />
<a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3236388">https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3236388</a></p>

<p>A topic that is recurrent to this newsletter: Storage. We talk about
it in different forms but it keeps coming back.</p></li>

<h2>Random</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Proving a point<br />
<a href="https://pudding.cool/2018/08/pockets/">https://pudding.cool/2018/08/pockets/</a></p>

<p>You know when you get in an argument and you feel like spending more
time than usual to prove your point, end up doing a research about
pocket in pants, then realize what you've done.</p></li>
<li><p>Novel way to produce electricity<br />
<a href="https://qz.com/1355672/stacking-concrete-blocks-is-a-surprisingly-efficient-way-to-store-energy/">https://qz.com/1355672/stacking-concrete-blocks-is-a-surprisingly-efficient-way-to-store-energy/</a></p>

<p>Hydroelectric dam are not a new thing but this is quite surprising,
lifting and letting concrete blocks falls. What do you think, can it
compete with category 2 energy storage?</p></li>
<li><p>On Bullshit<br />
<a href="http://www5.csudh.edu/ccauthen/576f12/frankfurt__harry_-_on_bullshit.pdf">http://www5.csudh.edu/ccauthen/576f12/frankfurt__harry_-_on_bullshit.pdf</a><br />
<a href="http://sebpearce.com/bullshit/">http://sebpearce.com/bullshit/</a></p>

<p>"This discrepancy is common in public life, where people are frequently
impelled - whether by their own propensities or by the demands of
others - to speak extensively about matters of which they are to some
degree ignorant. Closely related instances arise from the widespread
conviction that it is the responsibility of a citizen in a democracy
to have opinions about everything". It would be nice to learn to say
"I don't know".</p></li>

<h2>Unix</h2>

<a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1273675">https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1273675</a><br />
<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=4A302B0A84B9D881DC5888208EAFBB91?doi=10.1.1.86.5214&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=4A302B0A84B9D881DC5888208EAFBB91?doi=10.1.1.86.5214&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf</a></p>

<p>I'm not sure if this paper is supposed to be freely available, so if
you have university or library access to research paper better pass
through that medium. However I can't discern any difference between
the one I've linked and the one from the acm. This papers deals with
approaches on teaching Unix and what can learned from it, "the purpose
of teaching Unix" and why it's important to articulate it clearly to
students. A very valuable paper indeed.</p></li>
<li><p>Unprivileged fs mount<br />
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/755593/">https://lwn.net/Articles/755593/</a></p>

automount as normal user, find out in this small lwn.</p></li>

<p>One presentation at BSDCan 2018 about "The Tragedy of systemd"
and 3 blog posts on a systemd adventure related to NTP, related to
"Dynamic user allocation" and mounting in issue 44. That first
presentation goes over what init systems and services are about,
and daemons, maybe related to the podcast about daemons, find it here

<p>Fuzzing in userland being integrated into NetBSD, this will add huge
bug fighting capabilities. More about bugs with the last post.</p></li>
<li><p>GOT<br />
<a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/papers/13203/">https://www.exploit-db.com/papers/13203/</a></p>

<p>More on security. No this isn't an acronym for something else, this
is the Global Offset Table. I've been trying this thing on multiple
machines and OSs for days now but this doesn't seem reproducible
anymore. Still a great way to learn about processes structure.</p></li>
<li><p>TLS X509 Certificates<br />
<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/rfc-8446-aka-tls-1-3/">https://blog.cloudflare.com/rfc-8446-aka-tls-1-3/</a><br />

<p>We've shared a bunch of stuffs related to the PKI in this newsletter
before, see "Security and networking" in 77, "CAs are big and powerful
-> bad?" in 73, "TLS 1.3" in 68, "TLS v1.3" in 56. This is a follow
up on those, and as usual with cloudflare it's a good technical
post. The second text file in the list is for the persons who have
or are looking for explanations on the x509 format and extensions,
as I've been working with those at my day job it's interesting to see
all that unfolding and not sound like an alien language anymore.</p></li>
<li><p>Complexity rising in the DNS system<br />
<a href="https://blog.powerdns.com/2018/03/22/the-dns-camel-or-the-rise-in-dns-complexit/">https://blog.powerdns.com/2018/03/22/the-dns-camel-or-the-rise-in-dns-complexit/</a><br />

<p>More on RFCs. You can implement stuffs by looking at pcap only or look
through the 3000 RFCs of DNS. As things build in complexity the number
of people that are knowledgeable about the ins and outs are gradually
reduced to peanuts. Somethings needs to be done about legacy and the
way the information is passed down. "Standardizers enjoy complexity
but do not personally bear the costs of that complexity."</p></li>
<li><p>Building a stupid network for the best<br />
<a href="http://isen.com/stupid.html">http://isen.com/stupid.html</a></p>

<p>Continuing with the previous post but for the networking
infrastructure. That's a topic that keeps emerging: backward
compatibility and inheritance over years. Legacy becomes intelligent
in a bad way. Closely related to "The world goes round and round"
in issue 46.</p></li>
<li><p>"Documented Unix Facilities Over 48 Years"<br />

<p>Diomidis Spinellis is the same author as the book linked in "Incorrect
data initialization" all the way back in issue number 2. As with the
first link in this newsletter, try getting access through your library
or university first if you can. This is the research paper that the
"Navigate the history of Unix tools" in 68 is based on.</p></li>

<p>Two fun cases of Unix usage, one is about running X on very small
devices and the other is similar to what we saw last week in "Everyday
tools" (issue 87) about parsing humongous files.</p></li>

<h2>Random</h2>

<li><p>Camera in side-scroller games<br />

<p>Taking the Chinese room thought experiment a bit further and in a more
complicated way. I'm not so convinced of the follow up on the thoughts
but the author does a good job at defending it at least.</p></li>
<li><p>Visualization of markov chains<br />

<p>Visualization is a great way to learn.</p></li>

<h2>Thoughts</h2>

<p>Everything in life has an expiry date, especially for electronics. Some
companies even plan ahead this expiry date and indirectly forces you to
buy new. But also, most of the things can be repaired, the question is
if it's worth the effort to repair it.</p>

<p>A list of cool hardware from a NetBSD conference, plus the famous

security too (certainly not as much as OpenBSD though), check its
veriexec (see <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/532778/">https://lwn.net/Articles/532778/</a> too, a bit different

<p>We've tackled resource usage and performance monitoring a lot in
this newsletter but most of the tools we've put forward are very
specific. One that comes to mind is "Memory and optimizations" in issue
number 39 and "Desktop Management Interface (DMI)" in 18. Let's bring
the tone down a bit and try something easier, while not necessarily 100%
accurate, for once.</p></li>

you're going to get. Parsing sitemaps using a single line and making

<p>In continuation with the previous links, if you remember from "Security
and networking" in issue 77 Firefox is starting a new project to do
DNS over HTTPs (DoH) and Trusted Recursive Resolver, that first article
goes into depth why the author thinks it's a bad idea. The second one is
also on the topic of anonymity (Maybe also digital identity). The last
link is related to a remake of the web, see "You might have heard of
gopher, what about Xanadu" in 76, and probably also related to all those
"state of the web" links that were shared in the past. In my opinion,
the web is already a web outside the browser.. And that also reminds
me of are.na in "Connecting Ideas" of issue 15, a wonderful website.</p></li>

<p>In continuation with the previous link, this one goes into letting go
of the past when it comes to theming... Or not really. This article
also discusses Gtk, theming, and if it's right to leave the default
core style instead of overriding it. Do we stop customizing the Gnome
shell, and stop customizing Gtk themes, does the project go in a
similar direction as Mozilla did with Firefox. Seems like a week with
pondering over the direction of the project, good that this is being
initiated. We end in a corporate note with how it's important (maybe)
to pierce the desktop market.</p></li>

<p>Making the environment cleaner to live in, pure and pristine, should
be on everyone's mind. Sad to think that for the ones who can make a
difference this is all a business and when this business isn't viable
anymore there's no reason to continue. There certainly are incentives
and money is one, there should be a way to make this lucrative
too. We can blame whichever body/systems/government we want instead
of taking responsibilities but this doesn't change that we need to
do something. Start with using less packaging and more reusable high
quality containers, buy local it'll need less transportation.</p></li>

<p>Yes, another "state of the web, state of the mind" piece, a good
summary. Tools are made to be used; when a knife is used to kill
someone, or let's say it better "when someone uses a knife to kill
someone", is it the knife that's at fault or the person? Should we have
regulations that made knives harmless because of that? Can you enter
anywhere with a knife on you? Wouldn't you be looked at funny if you
were walking around with hundreds of knives in your pocket selling them
to anyone passing by? What about building extremely dangerous knives
with advertisements on how lethal they can be? This is an analogy, a bad
one but a relatable one. "When you invent the ship, you also invent the
shipwreck.." Have fun remembering the awkward and uninformed questioning
of Zuckerberg, the over-used-by-career-politician-to-gain-votes
"What about the CHILDREN" arguments, and the unexpected surprise by
the general audience over their unawareness over the choice of their
digital tools usage "because they're free". Let's quote from the article
"These are the broad outlines of the tech backlash. But against what,
exactly, is the backlash? Is it against the ascendency of technology
as the driving principle of modern society?"</p></li>

<p>So much of the content about consciousness, unconsciousness, awareness,
mind, and brain have confusing and conflicting definitions (if any at
all) which only brings up mysticism and fictions on the topic. In those
articles we tackle those, the first two deal with the old mostly thrown
away but still over-used in media concept of psychoanalysis, but also
proposes a flat mind which is not something especially new but certainly
a bit reductionist and contrary to the usual discussion. The last one
is a reply to the first two, again with a clash of definitions, which
in my opinion he doesn't use the same one so is attacking something
entirely different... It might contribute to the mysticism or might not,
I'll leave it for you to judge and take whatever value from them or get
even more confused with this word jumble/war. Related to "The brain"
in 78, "The Grand Analogy" in 66.</p></li>

chosen is a bit foggy. The content is still fine, it's the way it's
communicated that's the issue. Let me know if I wasn't the only one
feeling that. The second one is still about git, a direct continuation
of "Git and emails" in 82. The last two are about GPG, its usages, and
trying to write alternatives. The last two posts are about GPG sort of
mixes the implementation with the protocol by saying that the protocol
has a "bad user experience and interface". The protocol doesn't say
anything about how to implement the user interface, it's a specification
document. Apart from that small note, it's a very cool post.</p></li>

<p>This is a superb resource on learning about the heap/malloc. It's well
explained though a bit hard to follow in some places. I've solved the
two challenges in the second and third links (it was fun, PM me if
you want them) however the second one about 1 byte overflow doesn't
seem to work on newer glibc (seems to work on 2.23 but not on 2.27).</p></li>

<a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/oomd">https://github.com/facebookincubator/oomd</a></p>

<p>An interesting take at managing process over memory usage instead of
letting the kernel handle it when it's in a dire situation. For the
worried, this one is under GPL(kernel requirements probably) so don't
worry. Related to issue 25 "malloc never fails on Linux... or does it?".</p></li>
<li><p>Another one about hiring<br />
<a href="https://www.stilldrinking.org/interviewing-is-broken">https://www.stilldrinking.org/interviewing-is-broken</a></p>

<p>We had that discussion earlier in "But didn't you write an embedded
os" of issue 75. It's pretty hard to set up an interview process that
correctly assess the potential of a would-be-future-employee, it's
easy to do an interview process for someone who you'll hire only to
work on a task and then move on, but asking random unrelated questions
seems like a waste of time to both parties.</p></li>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are known knowns. There are things we know that we know. There
  are known unknowns. That is to say, there are things that we know we
  don't know. But there are also unknown unknown. There are things we
  don't know we don't know. - Donald Rumsfeld</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A seemingly humble quote that should certainly be put in its
context. Rumsfeld was a politician and this was something he said
following 9/11 regarding "weapons of mass destruction" and the lack of
evidence for them. There are multiple aspects to this, on one level it
reminds us of our relation with our knowledge, on another it gives you
a moment to stop and think before assuming or over-rationalizing, and
finally it shows that cheesy quotes are often posted on social media
without checking their background story (yet another week with cheesy
quotes, I know!).</p>

<p>For those who don't have access to a research database you can PM me
for a link or simply search for it online (your responsibility). This
is a paper about making pipes faster by using the power of multiple
processors and mixing this with an intricate use of the VFS. This
puts in question what was discussed in the previous link or actually
confirms it. Maybe related to "Parallelism in any Bourne shell" in 17.</p></li>

<p>A change that was also done on Arch a few years back (~2013), here
we see the adaptive decisions that some distributions have to make to
support specific programs that rely on this and also to make them more

<p>Those hackatons are great, they seem to push forward a lot of good
engineering. PkgsrcCon and OpenBSD hackaton. One of our old member
gave a talk there, hello yrmt! There's probably too much content to
consume in a week, I only could check a few of those. Similarly to
"Hackathon and secure chats" in 76, I'm still a huge proponent of
those types of posts.</p></li>

<p>Just ideas by bloggers, one about how there's a need for a small
but usable Unix-like system. This is related to sortix in "POSIX"
of issue 65 and fuzix in "Very small Unix" of issue 15. Another about
the state of the touchpad on Linux, also related to "The mouse is so
fast on your machine" in 75.</p></li>

<p>Because this is the trendy new thing in town, an unusual contraption
called a shower. I stole that from HN and thought it was a nice article,
similar to "Remote Control" in 82, "A history of the picnic table"

<p>It's been a while since I've shared something with the "state of the
internet", so here's one about quitting but not quitting entirely. The
writer goes through a weird complex and filtering process (sort of
related to the obsessive over-rationalization of "Goddess Spreadsheet"
in 28). It's like the middle-ground between smoking 10 packs a day
and saying 5 cigs a day won't kill you - The underlying reason why
you smoke hasn't changed in both cases, you haven't tackled the issue.</p></li>

<p>Spend time with your friends this week. This is what I'm going to do
and I hope this is going to be super fun for everyone! "In general
you want friends with whom you can have a meaningful conversation. You
can call them on a bad day and they will care. Your group of friends
are better than any drug or anti-aging supplement, and will do more

<p>All cyberpunk unite! This post goes into a simple technique to create
glitchy videos, a new but old trend on youtube. It's nice that this
is coming back to life. This seems to be the thing these days: Remake
whatever is old cool again. There's certainly a marketing idea behind
that to target people based on nostalgia but still, I ain't got anything
against that as long as we're deliberately choosing to revive memories.</p></li>

<p>Three quotes that are pretty much encompasses the same idea, to do things

<p>A review of what was seen in "sbrk and malloc" in 53 plus much more

<p>So the discussion about init system starts again. This time we'll take
it even more seriously and technically. The first series of docs go

<p>It seems we're talking too much about systemd but there's a reason
for that: It keeps adding more features to itself. You can choose to
ignore it or to read and learn about what's up with it and if you
can get ideas (to do or not) for your own projects and research on
init/system&amp;service-manager/super-server-daemon.</p></li>

impenetrable code. I'll quote something from the newcomers podcast:
"Those condescending persons might sound elitist but it’s a sort
of wall of entry which may appear intriguing to new ones. They might
want to get behind the wall with the others, it’s tempting to become
yourself a condescending guy/gal. It could be in itself a drive to
learn but it’s wrong to add fuel to the fire."</p></li>

<p>This article takes it from the side of productivity (see "Over-Productive"
in 78, "Production" in 66, and "The busy trap" in 32) however this is not
really accurate as many of the most prominent inventors didn't have the
mindset we today portray as overly obsessed with managing their time and
work. The other side of it is that it's a reflection on paying attention
to what matters to you, an appreciation of life.</p>

<p>Remote control started as anti-ads then brought up the habit of channel
surfing and slouching in the couch. Nowadays we're slowly seeing the
rise of voice interfaces which are more integrated and less hindering
to our dynamic lives, and the same goes for smart watches and phones
that can remotely control all the IoT connected devices. It seems
we've moved away and are somewhat repulsed by "laziness", we're on
an ever growing trend of efficacy and production mania. However,
a sentence of the first article caught my attention, it reflects a
feeling about the emergent tech and most early adopters, a sort of
signaling: "Remotes suggested that their owner was himself high-tech
and in demand, so busy and important he could not possibly cross the

<p>I've always liked this quote, I have no clue if it's true but from
anecdotal evidence I can assert it. Aren't the advices about being "more
confident" pullulating the online self-help trend trying to say indirectly
that we have to take ourselves and things in general less seriously. Yep,
cheesy social media quote that actually has more in it than it looks.</p>

<p>It's important to have a good history, maybe leaving some useless
commits once in a while doesn't kill but overall you want to be able

cheers. Check out the protocol it's an interesting and simple one using

<h2>Unix</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Writing services with systemd<br />
<a href="https://blog.akerl.org/2016/05/26/systemd-services-are-easy/">https://blog.akerl.org/2016/05/26/systemd-services-are-easy/</a><br />

<p>We've shared a lot of content already about systemd like "systemd gui"
in 54, and many more like "Yet another systemd article" in 37. Take
those ones as a complements to the others.</p></li>
<li><p>Dreaming about shells<br />
<a href="https://rain-1.github.io/shell-2.html">https://rain-1.github.io/shell-2.html</a></p>

<p>Rethink the shell, think powershell. Do you like that? Why?</p></li>
<li><p>BSD on desktop and more GUI stuffs<br />

<p>A continuation of the vermaden blog posts (which there are more at
the moment but I won't link) plus another update of KDE and stuffs
related to UX. The browser integration inside the desktop is an
intriguing concept. Someone commented on the vermaden posts that
they are too basic and not containing useful information however I
disagree on that. I think it's a space that needs to be filled and
whenever someone tries to write content for beginners explaining
every component of a functioning desktop environment they are met
with similar feedbacks. Two other projects that come to mind but
that are still lacking are <a href="https://github.com/feroldi/ricing">https://github.com/feroldi/ricing</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/nixers-projects/ricerous">https://github.com/nixers-projects/ricerous</a>.</p></li>

<p>"It's all just text", right, like we said last week, however text
parsing can be consuming. This guy reduces the consumption from 7GB
to 32KB.</p></li>

<p>I had no clue of this privilege escalation trick. When you think about
it it makes sense but it's a pretty big flaw.</p></li>

<p>Reverse engineering software and a new lovely blogger to follow (it's
the same person as the cool "Bootstraping issues" entry in 23, so not
really new).</p></li>
<li><p>Deduplication on the command line<br />
<a href="http://git.2f30.org/dedup/file/README.html">http://git.2f30.org/dedup/file/README.html</a></p>

<p>No need for that Virtual Data Optimizer layer of "VDO, A new layer to
add to the data storage stack" in 71, you can get simple deduplication
on the command line. It's harder to manage but it's simpler to
setup. Give it a try.</p></li>
<li><p>Booting on Unix<br />
<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/LinuxBootOverview">https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/LinuxBootOverview</a></p>

<p>I've tried myself at explaining the booting process on Unix before, as
clumsily as I could. Here the author does it in a much more compacted
and clean way with a focus on points of failures.</p></li>

<a href="https://mpc.sh/blog/a-gentle-intro-to-plt/">https://mpc.sh/blog/a-gentle-intro-to-plt/</a></p>

<p>I started to dabble a bit with bison the past few weeks, checking

<h2>Thoughts</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Every choice we make allows us to manipulate the future. Do I ask
  Adrienne or Suzanne to the spring dance? Do I take my holiday on Corsica
  or Risa? A person's life, their future, hinges on each of a thousand
  choices. Living is making choices! Now you ask me to believe that if
  I make a choice other than the one that appears in your history books,
  then your past will be irrevocably altered. Well, you know, Professor,
  perhaps I don't give a damn about your past, because your past is my
  future. And as far as I'm concerned, it hasn't been written yet!" -

  <p>"From this moment forward all my writings are fish hooks: perhaps I
  know how to fish as well as anyone - If nothing was caught, I am not to
  blame. There were no fish." - Nietzsche</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An idea similar to the thoughts in issue 74: Push your ideas out there in
the wild, without spoon feeding people, without following the clickbait
trend, all you have to do is prepare the content in the most appropriately
consumable way for anyone that ever encounters it.</p>

<p>Making a good, secure, fast (or slow), hashing function is not easy,
everyone is going to try to find flaws in it, break it. Side channel
attacks aren't obvious. Be sure to check the comments on the second

their insights.</p></li>

touched what the author of this article is talking about, binfmt misc:
Setting default programs internally in the Linux kernel via the procfs
interface.</p></li>

<p>The first article is a rough simplification/introduction to TLS
handshakes, somehow related to "TLS 1.3" in 68. The second is an audit
of the NetBSD network stack. I admire the patience taken to do those
security audi, perusing the code for days looking for typos, overflows,
mistakes, ways to abuse it.</p></li>

<p>In continuation with "I haven't covered cmake" in 65, let's add autoconf
to the tool set. The last article is somewhat unrelated, it's a C
programming tip so that gcc gives a warning when using generic pointers.</p></li>

<p>Remember the podcast about data storage well I've been revisiting it
on my personal blog and adding illustrations. One of the confusing
part of the explanation was related to role of the device mapper
and the various modules that implement it. Those posts, though old
(distros now support full disk encryption), should clarify that.</p></li>

<p>Remember our adventure with netlink in issue 59 "Procfs, capabilities,
and netlinks", well, we continue on, this is one of the reason according
to the author why the deprecation of netstat and ifconfig were made. But
here's the question: Will we replace all the tools that use procfs
and replace them by netlink/binary-blobs/IPC&amp;RPC-whatever everytime
we think it might affect their performance.</p></li>

<p>We're social animals, comparing one another is the drive that leads to
progress. However in today's world interactions are leading to some harm
when it comes to self-love. Somehow related to "..State of the mind"
in 75. The following video is my response to the one thing I thought
was enraging in the first article: It's nice to focus on bringing
back self-worth however the article sounded like it was written for
the management team of a business. Making people less judgemental of
themselves shouldn't be about increasing their productive outputs,
it should be about making them feel better and the rest is out of scope.</p></li>

<p>While those opinion pieces are by nature about an American centered

about when it comes to social movements. It is related to "Public

<p>A follow up on #73 "Recursive make", here we get the not only recursive
Make but "all Make are evil". Their solution is arguably more confusing
than Makefiles, smells too much of Haskell fanaticism, and maybe is
only suited for a paper and not practical usage outside the Haskell
community. Interesting nevertheless!</p></li>

keeps asking questions that never end, going deeper and deeper, starting

<p>It's nice to read the progress of open source team projects in blog
posts like those. It is especially the case for fresh ones as it
attracts eyeballs and incites contributors. It's also amazing to see
everyone in the team writing their own experience of the hackfest,
I never participated in anything resembling this but it makes me
want to. If anyone knows of a hackathon or conference that would be
interesting hit me up, I might join. Moreover, I'll try to write more
about my own projects, and you should too.</p></li>

that assumes possible workers will have a certain skillset to join in
instantly and start fixing whatever they have or want to have. Other
jobs are more long term, employee types of job where you're required
to grow along the way and learn from senior to become an essential

  <p>Sand mandalas are incredibly intricate works of art that take many
  people many days to construct. They’re very expressive, but fragile,
  works of art.</p>

  <p>After a mandala has been constructed – and displayed – it is
  ceremoniously deconstructed – which is meant "to symbolize the Buddhist
  doctrinal belief in the transitory nature of material life."</p>

  <p>&#95;why’s entire online presence and code was presented in the sand mandala
  that was '&#95;why'. The person behind '&#95;why' simply decided to move

<p>There aren't a lot of good approachable articles explaining how to
develop in the X windowing system. I'm currently planning on writing
more on this topic myself and if you're able to then join in and
also write. Other articles that were mentioned in the newsletter:
"Explaining X11" in 3, "Dark is the history of X11" in 36, and the
X11 section in "Low level graphics" in issue 42. However, even those
can be quite confusing with terms like pixmap, rendering, redirecting,
unredirecting, reparenting, composition, etc.. And so that's the reason
I'm going to be writing the articles.</p></li>
<li><p>Fast file system<br />
<a href="https://docs.freebsd.org/44doc/smm/05.fastfs/paper.pdf">https://docs.freebsd.org/44doc/smm/05.fastfs/paper.pdf</a></p>

<p>A paper about how the original UNIX file system was optimized for
throughput. Increase of block size, allowing block fragmentation,
allocating on the same cylinder, long file names, symbolic links,
and more.</p></li>
<li><p>CPU optimizations<br />
<a href="https://dendibakh.github.io/blog/2018/04/22/What-optimizations-you-can-expect-from-CPU">https://dendibakh.github.io/blog/2018/04/22/What-optimizations-you-can-expect-from-CPU</a></p>

<p>Compilers optimize according to how the CPU may react to how the code
is spread out, but the CPU also does it too, eliminating useless
instructions. In this article there's some discussion about that,
somehow related to "About memory" in 58 and "A summary" in 64.</p></li>
<li><p>mdoc<br />
<a href="https://manpages.bsd.lv/mdoc.html">https://manpages.bsd.lv/mdoc.html</a></p>

<p>Writing man pages is not easy. This book is a guide on writing good
manpages using mdoc, keep it bookmarked for the next time you have to
use it.</p></li>
<li><p>Recursive make<br />
<a href="http://aegis.sourceforge.net/auug97.pdf">http://aegis.sourceforge.net/auug97.pdf</a></p>

<p>Relates to the earlier "Recursive Make" in 71, the paper, which is
smooth to read, goes into the crevasses of why this isn't such a good
idea and how to remediate.</p></li>
<li><p>Term emulators<br />

<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/751763/">https://lwn.net/Articles/751763/</a></p>

<p>A big overview of the features, support, usability, and speed of
different terminal emulators. It was the first time I hear about some
of those features.</p></li>
<li><p>Unix philosophy<br />
<a href="https://nedbatchelder.com//blog/201804/do_one_thing.html">https://nedbatchelder.com//blog/201804/do_one_thing.html</a></p>

<p>It's not called "philosophy" for nothing, let's dig deeper in the
semiotics. Taking the words too literally or not, having problems
with ambiguity.</p></li>
<li><p>Concurrency<br />
<a href="https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/">https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/</a></p>

<p>Exploring a new way of doing concurrent tasks. You may somehow find
this related to "More Pike Wave?" in 30 and "PikeWave by jmbi/ibmj" 27.</p></li>

<p>Are CAs too powerful, are they allowed to revoke certificates that they
deem are dangerous to the security of the PKI, should CA pass moral
or legal judgement, should the CA act when they have the opportunity,
are EV certs really worth it as human control or they make no sense
because they depend on the UI display, should the guy of the first
article have been left with his cert, should we follow the letter of
the law or the spirit of the law? I'll let you make your own opinion.</p></li>

<p>Working with UTF is a bit of a pain. The first link
is a mini lib to help you handle that. Personally
I've recently used the fontconfig string utilities instead
(<a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/fontconfig/fontconfig-devel/x103.html#AEN4792">https://www.freedesktop.org/software/fontconfig/fontconfig-devel/x103.html#AEN4792</a>).

insightful in this case.</p></li>

<p>One article about how moving a "legacy" Perl package from core to
external deps could break some web hosting because they'll forget to
install it, another about captchas and how to do it better (we're
already seeing a lot of companies ditch captchas), and mapping the
whole internet.</p></li>

<p>The WIMP, the defacto UI design is fading in the trend, the first
article discusses why. As far as the second one is concerned with
the developer side of GUI devs, the author considers a bunch of very
interesting options while not talking about others such as kivy, tk,
shoesrb, etc..</p></li>

<li><p>Signatures as biometric, probably not<br />
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/08/business/credit-card-signatures.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/08/business/credit-card-signatures.html</a><br />

<p>Analysing signatures isn't a good mean to identify someone. As anyone
that has ever listened to documentary about tracing history and how
handwriting can be reassign to their original author knows, it's not
as simple as it sounds. You need many pages of documents to be able
to somehow, approximately, probably, say it was the right person. In
the legal field this isn't even considered strong evidence anymore.</p></li>

<p>The history of the word ludite is interesting by itself, and also
the current definition. There are some persons that have difficulties
with tech, or maybe those are difficulties with addiction and not the
technology itself. Some others have a morbid fascination with efficiency
and control of themselves. Maybe passionately, like the n=1 movement and
nootropics, regardless of their validity or not. In the end it comes
down to doing things deliberately. The second blog is about detaching
yourself from "harmful to privacy" services. The last two articles come
in pair, and I'm shamelessly pushing one of my own article because the
NYT one reminded me of it. Also related to "Compartmentalization" in 62.</p></li>

  <p>For they do not appear to me to have lost the faculty of reasoning,
  but having joined together some ideas very wrongly, they mistake
  them for truths; and they err as men do that argue right from wrong

  their fancies for realities, they make right deductions from them.</p>

<p>Another one related to "Assholes" in issue 15. I think the idea is
clear but it's good to keep repeating it. I'm wondering, is it a social

layers, right? Well this time we insert a new one between the block
and partition/volume-management one that has for role to deduplicate
and compress data sent or coming from the disk. As it's placed here
it is thus file system independent but requires this VDO to be able
to read properly from the physical SCSI layer.</p></li>

<p>I think I've shared so much related to this topic this year that I
don't need to put a summary. I'm glad those conversations are taking
place, this is a historical moment, I hope 2018 will be remember as a
year that reflected this. The four articles stand in pair, the second
ones in the pair are reply to the first. While the first pair is more
or less technical, the second one is pungent with technology and social
network mysticism. I'm inserting those links here but if you want relief
check the series "The WWW is awesome" and "Beauty is found in details"
I've started in the Random section. The last link doesn't seem directly
encroached with the others but it is, a beautiful peace.</p></li>

engineering could possibly do in Eutopia land.</p>

<p>"Beauty is found in the details", this time we're tackling Chinese
fonts. Language is such a complex topic. The past month I've been
working with fonts, discussing fonts with a graphic designer friend,
etc.. A character, aka grapheme, are only a single aspect, logograph,
phonograph. So much to learn, so much to respect!</p></li>

<p>It's quite hard to make a website that is accessible on all devices
and by most persons, even the ones with disabilities. I've been lately
checking this specification regarding contrast and text readability,
the website should be accessible when zoomed at 200%, however not all
browser's change, nor agree if they should, their screen.width when
zooming. Firefox doesn't, Chrome does, I have no clue about others.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Another sandboxing solution<br />
<a href="http://www.plash.beasts.org/index.html">http://www.plash.beasts.org/index.html</a></p>

<p>Related to issue 49 "Wrap it in a sandbox on Linux". Nothing novel,
simply a mention.</p></li>
<li><p>Microcode<br />
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Microcode">https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Microcode</a></p>

<p>Until a while ago (spectre and meltdown), I had no clue the encoded
instructions inside the processor could be upgraded. It still bugs me.</p></li>
<li><p>New public service in town<br />
<a href="https://devnull-as-a-service.com/one-less-to-go.sh">https://devnull-as-a-service.com/one-less-to-go.sh</a></p>

<p>In the land of useless we've got a new contender.</p></li>
<li><p>Regression and ports to other OS<br />
<a href="https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/issues/7401">https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/issues/7401</a></p>

<p>Sometimes the price of using some technology is high but maybe the
benefits are big enough to compensate. Filesystems are one of those, you
don't want it to break. However without testing there is no polishing,
here's a case of beautiful polishing.</p></li>
<li><p>Process tree<br />
<a href="https://phoxis.org/2013/11/25/process-tree-of-linux-system/">https://phoxis.org/2013/11/25/process-tree-of-linux-system/</a><br />
<a href="https://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=1925">https://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=1925</a></p>

<p>An explanation on how to write a program to trace a Linux process
tree and a discussion about finding the PID of the terminal a script
is running on.</p></li>
<li><p>A myth about security<br />
<a href="https://gettys.wordpress.com/2018/04/09/mythology-about-security/">https://gettys.wordpress.com/2018/04/09/mythology-about-security/</a></p>

<p>And as with every myth it is debunked in the article.</p></li>
<li><p>UCLA Unix<br />
<a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/55f7/e4d8719cbdfe8cdc9fa77ed7a5f62bfba784.pdf">https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/55f7/e4d8719cbdfe8cdc9fa77ed7a5f62bfba784.pdf</a></p>

<p>A research paper about an OS built with demonstrable data security in
mind. This OS, as old as it is (remember the previous link), already
implemented and advanced version of the concept of process capabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Network audio, mpd+sndio<br />
<a href="https://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&amp;sid=20180410063454">https://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&amp;sid=20180410063454</a></p>

<p>Most readers of this newsletter have used mpd and so are familiar with
the <code>audio_output</code> configuration. This articles goes into skipping the
http output and replace it by a direct sndio output (it has network
support).</p></li>
<li><p>Kernel lockdown and uefi secure boot<br />
<a href="https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/50577.html">https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/50577.html</a></p>

<p>A discussion about a recent patch that would enable kernel lockdown
directly when booting from UEFI with secure boot. The kernel built to
look like an EFI executable.</p></li>
<li><p>New ways of thinking for devs<br />

<a href="https://sonniesedge.co.uk/talks/dear-developer">https://sonniesedge.co.uk/talks/dear-developer</a></p>

<p>Two new ideas to integrate in your learning experience as a dev or
hobbyist. The last articles is a great segue into the random section.</p></li>

<p>Moving from directories to directories isn't <em>efficient</em> enough,

<li><p>ELF modules<br />
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/749108/">https://lwn.net/Articles/749108/</a></p>

<p>The introduction of a new kind of kernel module, inspired by the recent

<p>I've been reading about the render extension in the past days and
I can clearly assess that this is a similar issue as with the font
stack ("More on typography" in issue 63): It's the same small group
of persons that know about this tech that is scarcely documented. So,
read up, educate yourself about it and maybe we can turn this around.</p></li>

other types of media are we not using that could solve this?</p>

<p>It might not look like it at first sight but this is related
to "The Grand Analogy" in 66 and "The extended mind" in 64,
and a bit of "Keeping track of your things" thread on the forums
(<a href="https://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=1637">https://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=1637</a>). This one challenges

<h2>Unix</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Let's review this one more time<br />
<a href="https://codeexplainer.wordpress.com/2018/03/01/have-fun-with-unix/">https://codeexplainer.wordpress.com/2018/03/01/have-fun-with-unix/</a></p>

<p>We've shared a lot of articles related to not-so-obvious C behavior,
so here's one more. It's the same puzzle as in "Why does it do
this?" of issue 45 but better explained.</p></li>
<li><p>sudo and setuid<br />
<a href="https://rcoh.me/posts/sudo-science/">https://rcoh.me/posts/sudo-science/</a></p>

<p>A walk through how sudo works by taking advantage of the setuid
bit. Somehow related to "Bash is secure" in issue 13, "Oh so confusing
setuid" in issue 8 and "Setuid... again!" in issue 28.</p></li>
<li><p>Extended attributes<br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_file_attributes">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_file_attributes</a><br />
<a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/CommonExtendedAttributes/">https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/CommonExtendedAttributes/</a><br />
<a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/chattr">https://linux.die.net/man/1/chattr</a><br />
<a href="https://linux-audit.com/using-xattrs-extended-attributes-on-linux/">https://linux-audit.com/using-xattrs-extended-attributes-on-linux/</a></p>

<p>I haven't seen any custom extended attributes being frequently used
in the wild other than for ACL and SELinux. The second link gives a
general overview of common usage they can have, as metadata outside
the file itself. It also explains something I've missed during
the "default programs" podcast, such as setting <code>user.mime_type</code>
to explicitly state the mime type of a file, along with other
"proposed" attributes that could possibly be respected by softwares
(<a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/">http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/</a>). The last 2 links are about
the usage of the command line tools that can be used on linux and BSD
to change the attributes.</p></li>
<li><p>ACL<br />
<a href="http://softpanorama.org/Access_control/acl.shtml">http://softpanorama.org/Access_control/acl.shtml</a><br />
<a href="https://crypto.stanford.edu/cs155old/cs155-spring09/lectures/17-access-os-sec.pdf">https://crypto.stanford.edu/cs155old/cs155-spring09/lectures/17-access-os-sec.pdf</a><br />

<a href="https://www.linux.com/learn/how-manage-user-permissions-gui-linux">https://www.linux.com/learn/how-manage-user-permissions-gui-linux</a></p>

<p>In continuation with the previous links, let's discuss another type
of metadata used for security, the POSIX ACLs. This is related to
"Securelevel" in issue 34, "And more on real security" in issue 45, and
"Procfs, capabilities, and netlinks" where we discussed capabilities in
issue 59. The eiciel gui can manage both ACLs and extended attributes.</p></li>
<li><p>Role based access aka rbac<br />
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/systems/security/custom-roles-rbac-jsp-140865.html">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/systems/security/custom-roles-rbac-jsp-140865.html</a></p>

<p>Similarly, Oracle/Sun has their homebaked version of it they call rbac.</p></li>

<p>In a world of ever growing bloatware how do we cope with it. One
solution is to increase the machine capacity, the other is to limit
what the software can have access to. I think from now on whatever
bloat software I want to keep running on my machine I'll start with
a wrapper shell script adding memory limit.</p></li>

<p>Monotoring CPU performance and usage isn't straight forward, this
article tackles the topic.</p></li>
<li><p>Interactive Linux kernel map<br />
<a href="http://www.makelinux.net/kernel_map/">http://www.makelinux.net/kernel_map/</a></p>

<p>The usual SVG showing a Linux system with zoomable and clickable text
that sends you straight to the source. I've tackled the whole (or at
least I've tried) storage one in the data storage on unix podcast
(<a href="https://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=2164">https://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=2164</a>), maybe we should do
others about different layers.</p></li>

maybe even avoiding it purposefully. The next episode is about the
role of distros, it's not even related at all. In all cases, read up
those old articles, maybe we'll be able to do something about init

<p>The state of handheld Linux devices and the state of online video. Both
are interesting articles.</p></li>
<li><p>More on Debian ranting<br />
<a href="https://tingping.github.io/2018/03/02/when-distros-get-it-wrong.html">https://tingping.github.io/2018/03/02/when-distros-get-it-wrong.html</a></p>

<p>Remember the past week series of nag about Debian, issue 64 "Nagging
about Debian", it seems like there's a continuity there. The message has
gone around and now people feel entitled to give their opinions. Read
up, it's an interesting debate, is it ok to bring back to life old
software projects. Is it more ok then to add new projects to the repo?</p></li>
<li><p>Bash completion<br />
<a href="https://iridakos.com/tutorials/2018/03/01/bash-programmable-completion-tutorial.html">https://iridakos.com/tutorials/2018/03/01/bash-programmable-completion-tutorial.html</a></p>

<p>zsh has a reputation for its completion system, but we shouldn't forget
bash has something similar and that it's the default on many systems.</p></li>
<li><p>XFS<br />
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/747633/">https://lwn.net/Articles/747633/</a></p>

<p>You might have heard of XFS once as the fs for "big files", you might
have read a bunch of articles in the past weeks about filesystems in
general and how data is layed out. This is time to mix those together
and see what's up these days with XFS in the Linux realm. There's a
nice talk about what subvolumes actually mean.</p></li>
<li><p>POSIX<br />

<p>It's nice to explore different OS that are POSIX compliant. <code>sortix</code>
has a lot of interesting stuffs going on, apart from all the underlying
base, it has its own editor, package manager and much more. Download
it and try it out.</p></li>
<li><p>Wihtout libc<br />

<p>On the topic of starting from scratch, very similar to "Tiny ELF"
in issue 47 and "The world most prominent virus has erased all the

<p>This is probably the blog I've shared the most so far but it's worth
it. Related to the previous two posts, we again ask about the common
root, this time we're taking a look at fread and fwrite.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally a new podcast<br />
<a href="https://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=2191">https://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=2191</a></p>

<p>After a hiatus of 4 months here comes a new episode of the podcast. In
this episode we're tackling scripts, glue code, the original Unix tools,
and their history. We're going to see why it matters nowadays. Be sure
to also check the comments on the thread, as picky as they might seem
they still bring some new info to the topic.</p></li>
<li><p>I haven't covered cmake<br />
<a href="https://github.com/pyk/cmake-tutorial">https://github.com/pyk/cmake-tutorial</a></p>

<p>In the last section of the podcast I didn't cover any build tool,
which there are way too many. I thought of mentioning cmake in this
issue as I'm not familiar with it and this tutorial is good but cmake
itself is kinda complex after all.</p></li>
<li><p>Xlib architecture and XCB<br />
<a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/usenix04/tech/freenix/full_papers/sharp/sharp_html/index.html">https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/usenix04/tech/freenix/full_papers/sharp/sharp_html/index.html</a></p>

the technology has to squish itself to fit the current expectation of
the users and not the other way around, even when sometimes it seems
like the opposite.</p></li>

<p>Vain takes us on a journey to explore how to build a terminal
emulator from scratch. Vain's approach at explaining is explorative,
which brings it to life. As we all know this topic doesn't
have many great articles and we're in need of more similar to
this one. You can also check the nixers podcast about Terminals
<a href="https://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=2108">https://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=2108</a> to refresh your mind

<a href="https://www.gilesorr.com/vim/slides/vimSyntaxOn.jpg">https://www.gilesorr.com/vim/slides/vimSyntaxOn.jpg</a>, it must be the
meme invasion that is influencing me. Regardless, we're reminded of
something related to the previous article, termcap and terminfo and
how it affects other programs such as less. It was nice to learn about
<code>lesskey</code>.</p></li>

<p>The ins and outs of window managers. Those are quite old
papers, 1988 and 2003 respectfully, and shamelessly we didn't
innovate that much since then. The papers also debunk a lot
of misconceptions, some discussions we already had on the
forums too: <a href="https://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=2135">https://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=2135</a>

<p>I found this amazing person who made a summary of two articles I've
shared, the paper of Drepper in issue 58 "About memory" and Eric
Raymond in issue 61 "On a roll with C". So if you've felt like you
missed content from the previous two then here's your chance to get
it back. Also, pay attention to the conclusion, some assumptions
were wrong.</p></li>

<p>This week there's a surge (resurge) of "typical blog posts", this
time the "internet mind" has chosen Debian. Get your popcorn ready
because this is gonna be fun. Would you call it the package managers
war? Where do you stand on this, to centralize package management or
not, discuss on the forums <a href="https://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=1883">https://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=1883</a>

<p>This is a fascinating topic that was shared multiple times, the links
are not new, check issue 34 "Xero's Weekly Ricing Tips". However,
I still felt like sharing them again. I've dig into fontconfig from
a developer point of view last weekend and noticed that I was wrong
about the following assumption: I thought it was the Xft library that
had the job of parsing the string representing how to match a font but
it's not, it's a feature of fontconfig, and this makes sense, and a
lot of articles online are full of misinformation about this. Xft sits
in the middle, as the glue code only. This reminded me, once again,
that: The font stack isn't that well understood. That we're still
missing tools to manipulate fontconfig, though some exists such as
<code>fontik</code> and <code>fonts-tweak-tool</code>, both from fedora. That the fontconfig
xml language isn't well understood either. That the persons that are
heavily involved in the projects are now Google employees and might
be busy, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raph_Levien">Raph Levien</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behdad_Esfahbod">Behdad Esfahbob</a>
for example. And finally that maybe we can start to bring awareness
to this topic if only we push out more demystifying posts in the
wilderness for others to read.</p></li>
<li><p>Viruses on Unix?<br />

something we got accustomed to hear with the recent iot hacks and
Ddos botnets.</p></li>

<p>From old to new, how the average blogger realized that BSDs are, like
all, not-immune to security flaws. As was said in the previous article:
"The promotion of the concept of <em>magical immunity</em> to computer viral
attacks surfaces on a regular basis. This concept, while desirable, is
misleading and dangerous since it tends to mask a real threat." Related
to issue 60 "Cruncy click baity" (yes it's typo), the CCC presentation
is what was discussed, it's a great presentation. The soldierx paper
technical details are a bit beyond me but I could grasp the gist of
the privilege escalation technique.</p></li>

<p>Setting up a mail server from scratch in 2018 is difficult, we need
automation, like with <code>iredmail</code> and the likes. Does this mean emails
are dead, probably not. The second article is about Wave a project
that was meant to be a "revolutionary communication protocol". It
didn't catch on and the author, which is also the creator of XCB,
meditates on why.</p></li>
<li><p>Building a Wayland compositor from scratch<br />
<a href="http://sircmpwn.github.io/2018/02/17/Writing-a-Wayland-compositor-1.html">http://sircmpwn.github.io/2018/02/17/Writing-a-Wayland-compositor-1.html</a><br />

<p>The lead dev of Sway starts a series of articles about how to use the
new lib wlroots to allow building compositor pieces more easily, so
it's not really from scratch after all. However, even though you have
a library get ready to be faced with a totally new world and learning
curve (the author doesn't do that good of a job at explaining and
throws specific words around assuming they are obvious).</p></li>
<li><p>Not so wget<br />
<a href="http://libdill.org/tutorial-sockets.html">http://libdill.org/tutorial-sockets.html</a></p>

<p>This isn't a copy of wget, not even close, it's an example on how to
use libdill, a new C concurrent library for concurrency (go-like). The
low-level stacking of protocols was nice to read, it couples well with
tls wrapping.</p></li>

<p>Dtrace is getting ported to Linux, this mean we'll get some new very
powerful debugging and tracing tool to play with from now on other than
<code>perf</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Console codes<br />
<a href="https://www.systutorials.com/docs/linux/man/4-console_codes/">https://www.systutorials.com/docs/linux/man/4-console_codes/</a></p>

<p>HCI applied to the command line. We already have backward search,
now think about a kind of way the shell could help you write the next
command, not only complete it.</p></li>
<li><p>Performance tunning hasn't changed much<br />
<a href="http://oceanpark.com/papers/gem01.html">http://oceanpark.com/papers/gem01.html</a></p>

<p>Some excellent and valuable tips that passed the test of time. <code>sar</code>
seems like the universal Unix logging tool.</p></li>
<li><p>Blocking processes<br />

<p>I can't sum it up better than: If you're a human being and you're
bothered by a human being, the only thing you can say is: "Not right
now, I'm busy. Go away!"</p></li>

<p>...That it doesn't really matter anymore. There is a group of persons
that are fanatics about that sort of things, not missing any tiny
bit of info. I personally think that it's interesting but that the
importance is not in those overly narrow details.</p></li>
<li><p>Fast regex<br />

<p>Regular expressions are one of the trademark of Unix history, in this
article there's a discussion on the theory of it: automatons, which
you might remember if you've ever taken a CS class.</p></li>
<li><p>Unix as an IDE<br />

<p>An idiom that is embraced by many of us, put together by the novel
concept of software as tools that was brought by Unix and more precisely
pipelines. I don't agree with most of the opinions expressed in some
of those articles nevertheless they're worth a read.</p></li>

<p>Linux everywhere! Sounds good to some and bad to others. This still
looks like a work in progress and not very accessible to anyone.</p></li>

<p>Those are timely articles, The Open Group was formed (by merging
two other groups, OSF and X/Open) in 1996 and published the Single
UNIX Specification: The end of the UNIX wars. Get ready for that
second article because it's full of topics that were covered by this
newsletter.</p></li>

<li><p>Compartmentalization<br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmentalization_(psychology)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmentalization_(psychology)</a></p>

<p>Hello there people that like to read stuffs related to psychology (and
those who don't). The topic of compartmentalization has been one of my
"Baader-Meinhof" aka frequency illusion for some time now... Well, it's
more of a temporary kind of focus on a certain topic and what relates
to it, it's deliberate and not really and illusion (I've seen the idea
repeated in multiple books and articles I've read). Compartmentalization
is the fabric of everyone of us, there are extreme cases like when
those separated parts are contradictory but even so our personality
lies within the connections of the compartment (which might explain
why when there opposites it leads to personality disorders). This has
been proven by many psychological experiments. Without them we do not
exist, boundaries with links between them are what define an individual
as a self. We can't be everything at once, we can't fulfil all our
roles in life at once, we can't be all of our personality traits at
once. The father cannot be at the same time the lover cannot be at the
same time the worker cannot be at the same time the friend, etc.. And
those have to stay within their confined boxes. Some social platforms
nowadays try to destroy those and put everything in the same box. This
turns an individual into a single blob, flattening their existence,
labelling, simplifying, breaking down, and leading to the destruction
of the self. Take this as food for thought for the week (and let me
know if going on a tangent like that in the newsletter is too much).</p></li>

  <p>We might be fighting with someone, and in the midst of the fight the
  phone rings. After some heated argument as to who will pick it up, we
  finally answer the phone with a voice and attitude that are in total
  contrast with what we were just portraying of ourselves in the argument.</p>

supported in the console!</p></li>
<li><p>On a roll with C<br />

<p>We discussed efficiency and optimization (pogo) in earlier issues,
this time let's put an emphasis on C structures. This is something
that is written in arguable depth in the paper of Drepper in issue 58
"About memory" but that I felt needed more articles and discussion
(because it's a super long paper packed with info).</p></li>
<li><p>A tool to go along with the previous docs<br />
<a href="https://github.com/jmesmon/pahole">https://github.com/jmesmon/pahole</a><br />
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/335942/">https://lwn.net/Articles/335942/</a></p>

<p>I've had difficulties using pahole (which is also mentioned in Eric
Raymond previous article but that he also hasn't tried himself either)
so if anyone can figure it out properly and write a tutorial it would
make the world a better place.</p></li>
<li><p>What to use other than statically linked executables<br />
<a href="https://github.com/Intoli/exodus">https://github.com/Intoli/exodus</a></p>

<p>Well, it actually rebuilds a statically linked executable, which is
really nifty in my opinion. Let's quote: "Exodus works around these
issues by compiling a small statically linked launcher binary that
invokes the relocated linker directly with any hardcoded RPATH library
paths overridden. The relocated binary will run with the exact same
linker and libraries that it ran with on its origin machine." If you
have no clue what that means you might want to read issue 54 "LD.SO".</p></li>
<li><p>Bring back to life using NetBSD<br />
<a href="https://www.geeklan.co.uk/files/fosdem2018-retro/#1">https://www.geeklan.co.uk/files/fosdem2018-retro/#1</a></p>

<p>NetBSD is supported on a lot of platforms that are marked as deprecated
for other OSs, this presentation quickly goes over some of the reasons
why and examples of this.</p></li>
<li><p>Writing filesystem drivers for Linux<br />
<a href="https://www.uninformativ.de/blog/postings/2017-09-09/0/POSTING-en.html">https://www.uninformativ.de/blog/postings/2017-09-09/0/POSTING-en.html</a></p>

<p>There's a lot to learn about filesystems, what better way to do it than
to have fun writing the interface to one. It's weird that I discovered
this post after having done the research for the podcast about data
storage on Unix, it could've been useful.</p></li>
<li><p>This week there are videos<br />
<a href="http://www.ixbrian.com/blog/?p=192">http://www.ixbrian.com/blog/?p=192</a></p>

<p>Quick tutorials mostly about systemd real world sysadmin usages.</p></li>
<li><p>BSD from scratch, source to OS (NetBSD)<br />
<a href="https://www.geeklan.co.uk/files/fosdem2018-bsd/#1">https://www.geeklan.co.uk/files/fosdem2018-bsd/#1</a><br />
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JctBMLQ_IdA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JctBMLQ_IdA</a></p>

<p>Flashy title, slow presenter (watch at least at 1.25x). To be fair the
presentation is about teaching how to build and present BSD systems
from scratch on boards (Raspberry Pi, BeagleBoard), though it goes a
lot off topic with resources and OS ideas. Aka, "get a copy of the
source, compile, build the OS, boot it on the ARM board, and work
through some exercises".</p></li>
<li><p>OpenBSD as a VPN box<br />
<a href="https://undeadly.org/features/2018/02/eurobsdcon2017-branch-vpn.pdf">https://undeadly.org/features/2018/02/eurobsdcon2017-branch-vpn.pdf</a></p>

<p>OpenBSD has a good reputation as a platform that is to be put on the
fighting lines of the network peripherals. The presentation goes over
setting up a VPN solution using OpenBSD. Warning alert for the high
amount of networking jargon (way more than I could grasp).</p></li>

the total opposite.</p>

didn't finish reading it (I didn't either, there are 30 pages left)
so keep this blog post queued for when you reach a point where you've
grasped how alignment affects code efficiency (as crazy as this sounds).</p></li>
<li><p>Compiler features<br />
<a href="https://phoxis.org/2011/04/27/c-language-constructors-and-destructors-with-gcc/">https://phoxis.org/2011/04/27/c-language-constructors-and-destructors-with-gcc/</a><br />

<p>More interesting compiler options that you may want to know about. There
are ton of small features in C compilers for optimization to twiddle.</p></li>
<li><p>strace vs dtrace vs strace<br />
<a href="https://sysdig.com/blog/sysdig-vs-dtrace-vs-strace-a-technical-discussion/">https://sysdig.com/blog/sysdig-vs-dtrace-vs-strace-a-technical-discussion/</a></p>

<p>We've discussed <code>sysdig</code> in issue 18, let's talk about it again and
about other process tracing programs. The tool itself is open source
and the company seems to be making money from the web interfaces that
it constructed around it, sort of added value benefits. There's also
<code>csysdig</code> a very cool open source curses interface for it which
resembles <code>htop</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Packing bytes natively what does that mean<br />
<a href="https://commandcenter.blogspot.com/2012/04/byte-order-fallacy.html">https://commandcenter.blogspot.com/2012/04/byte-order-fallacy.html</a></p>

<p>This article destroys misconception about byte ordering and how to do
it properly.</p></li>
<li><p>grep your way to freedom<br />
<a href="https://anniecherkaev.com/grep-your-way-to-freedom">https://anniecherkaev.com/grep-your-way-to-freedom</a></p>

<p>In 2013 the Oxford dictionary added grep as a noun and a verb:
<a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/grep">https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/grep</a>. In this article
you learn about the magic of hardcoded values and adventures to dig
them out of the ground.</p></li>

<p>There was a fruitful discussion on <a href="https://lobste.rs">https://lobste.rs</a> last week about
procfs formatting. It made me think of netlink and other interfaces
to get the same information. Then I've started testing with taskstats
which forced me to set capabilities on a copy of a python interpreter
so that I can try out a script using the <code>gnlpy</code> library without making
my system insecure.</p></li>

<p>A story some of us might have lived first hand. Highly keyboard oriented
editor in general give that liberty, not only vim.</p></li>
<li><p>Containers vs OS<br />

<p>Insightful discussion about the way that processes should be managed
if containerized (or not?). A bit of a reminder of the podcast about
processes intro sections. I love this kind of article, a monologue
based on questions after questions, expanding into deeper topics.</p></li>
<li><p>Unix influence in history<br />
<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~rh120/ch001j.c11">http://www.columbia.edu/~rh120/ch001j.c11</a></p>

<p>A tool for human view of the history of unix. "The coupling between
such a utility and the community it serves, is so strong that the
community is actually a part of the system itself." The article is
quite long but it's worth the read.</p></li>

<h2>Thoughts</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>"It is really true what philosophy tells us, that life must be
  understood backwards. But with this, one forgets the second proposition,
  that it must be lived forwards. A proposition which, the more it is
  subjected to careful thought, the more it ends up concluding precisely
  that life at any given moment cannot really ever be fully understood;
  exactly because there is no single moment where time stops completely
  in order for me to take position [to do this]: going backwards." -
  Søren Kierkegaard, in his journals (1843)</p>

<p>A case against not mixing multiple package managers but to use the
one of the distro. I'm in the favor of using a package from the repo
instead of one from a pkg manager for a specific language.</p></li>

<p>Low bandwith and want to download something, let it be stopped by
a proxy, saving the links to the usb, download on a computer with
fast internet, put back on the first machine, and proxied again and
downloaded from the usb. The other links are about inetd, which I just
learned about. Proxying the connection and piping it to stdin to a
program it will spawn on the fly to handle it.</p></li>

<p>Simulating PDP-11 Unix a.out binaries and reliving Unix V7. Those
are some really cool tasks to put things of today's world into
perspective. Remember when we discussed line discipline in the podcast
about Terminals?</p></li>

<p>I like differing ideas about all subjects but be sure to take them with
a grain of salt. Especially when the author seems a bit too enamored
with being similar to and justifying his idols. Somewhat related to
"Another old one that fires up arguments in the efficiency world" of
issue 55. The usage of the terms "places" vs "tools" fits properly in
my opinion.</p></li>
<li><p>Gdb, one of a kind<br />
<a href="http://www.codersnotes.com/notes/something-rotten-in-the-core/">http://www.codersnotes.com/notes/something-rotten-in-the-core/</a></p>

<p>Lasagna softwares can be tricky when its base is an ed-like ui. This is
related to the above, gdb being a "place" and not a "tool". Remember the
GUI for gdb in "A gui for gdb" of issue 23, this is criticized here too.</p></li>
<li><p>About memory<br />
<a href="https://people.freebsd.org/~lstewart/articles/cpumemory.pdf">https://people.freebsd.org/~lstewart/articles/cpumemory.pdf</a></p>

<p>I've been reading this book for about 2 weeks now and I'm halfway
through. It is by Ulrich Drepper which is the infamous lead developer
of glibc. There's a lot of low level discussion so beware (from how
the cpu cache works, to how the alignment affects performance, to how
code structure affects it, prefetching, etc..)</p></li>

<h2>Unix</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Virtual memory, fork, and processes<br />
<a href="http://sircmpwn.github.io/2018/01/02/The-case-against-fork.html">http://sircmpwn.github.io/2018/01/02/The-case-against-fork.html</a><br />

<p>Related to issue 25 "malloc never fails on Linux... or does it?" and the
fork() part of the podcast called "Processes on Unix". After reading
those you can continue with the new articles and learn about cloning
and spawning paradigms like <code>rfork</code>, <code>clone</code> and <code>spawn</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>More on VM<br />

<a href="https://github.com/qznc/annoying-build-systems">https://github.com/qznc/annoying-build-systems</a></p>

<p>In the spirit of the last few weeks, let's continue on this series
on articles about automating build. This is an ongoing public domain
list of regrouping all annoying build systems (all of them basically)
and why they are annoying.</p></li>
<li><p>Magnificent resource<br />
<a href="https://linuxjourney.com/">https://linuxjourney.com/</a></p>

<p>I've seen that website a while ago but it has grown so much since
then. It has become a beautiful resource that regroups a lot of the
basic knowledge around Unix/Linux. I would definitely recommend it
for anyone starting on their "journey".</p></li>
<li><p>Hardcoded strings horror<br />
<a href="https://www.sigbus.info/software-compatibility-and-our-own-user-agent-problem.html">https://www.sigbus.info/software-compatibility-and-our-own-user-agent-problem.html</a></p>

<p>Yet another case of "the more I learn, the less I'm surprised by
the stupidity". The author says it best: "This sad situation is
simultaneously a bit funny to me."</p></li>
<li><p>Running the latest Linux on 486<br />
<a href="http://yeokhengmeng.com/2018/01/make-the-486-great-again/">http://yeokhengmeng.com/2018/01/make-the-486-great-again/</a><br />
<a href="https://github.com/yeokm1/gentoo-on-486/">https://github.com/yeokm1/gentoo-on-486/</a></p>

<p>There was a lot of efforts going into putting this together. It takes
11min to boot even with a minimized kernel but it still runs.</p></li>
<li><p>Bash and shells<br />
<a href="https://zwischenzugs.com/2018/01/06/ten-things-i-wish-id-known-about-bash/">https://zwischenzugs.com/2018/01/06/ten-things-i-wish-id-known-about-bash/</a><br />

<a href="https://freebsdfrau.gitbooks.io/serious-shell-programming/">https://freebsdfrau.gitbooks.io/serious-shell-programming/</a></p>

<p>I don't usually click on articles that have numbers in their titles
(the nasty "listicles") but this one was more or less good with some
obvious content to many readers (though promoting the sale of a book -
This was to be foreseen!). This is put in contrast with an unfinished
mini book about shell portability, see issues 13 "Linters" with
<code>shellcheck</code>, 49 with "josuah's shell tricks", 17 with "Expansion &amp;
Globs" for the Bash Beginners Guide. Actually there are so many issues
discussing shell tricks and compatibility, I can't mention them all.</p></li>
<li><p>Plain text<br />

<a href="https://github.com/LuminosoInsight/python-ftfy">https://github.com/LuminosoInsight/python-ftfy</a></p>

<p>I'm not really sure how "plain text" has anything to do with the
first post... But the author seems to imply what he's doing is plain
text manipulation (inside a memory DB?). The other article is a case
against plain text or a circular argument against encodings. The last
project tries to fix unicode, it's impressive to see.</p></li>
<li><p>Egg hunting, what's that?<br />
<a href="https://pentesterslife.blog/2017/11/24/x64-egg-hunting-in-linux-systems/">https://pentesterslife.blog/2017/11/24/x64-egg-hunting-in-linux-systems/</a></p>

it has become an issue. This might be of religious origins but can easily
be taken out of this context and applied to anyone.</p>

at each reboot you have a different kernel (Linux had it since
2013). Linux wants, KASLR, on the fly different memory mapping of the
kernel, read up to know more... There's some weird conspiracy theory
in the background which unfolded in the recent days. If you remember

<p>They're everywhere, at every single level, hardware and software,
everything is cache. Thus you need to know your share of info about
them. In "Desktop Management Interface (DMI)" of issue 18 (Getting
info from the bios and hardware) we discussed some of that topic too,
<code>hwloc</code> is an amazing addition to the list.</p></li>
<li><p>Another fantastically deep article<br />
<a href="http://careers.directi.com/display/tu/Understanding+CPU+Utilization+and+Optimization">http://careers.directi.com/display/tu/Understanding+CPU+Utilization+and+Optimization</a></p>

<p>Remember "Memory and optimizations" of issue 39, well this is from the
same team called Directi, I'm not so sure what the company does but
they do publish some amazing content online about optimization. It's
probably more about the author, Bhavin Turakhia, also a founder of
CodeChef amongst other companies. The article, which is really good,
emphasises on processes scheduling and CPU utilization, you can
read/listen to the podcast about processes before tackling it.</p></li>

<p>This is the paradise for anyone in QA. A lot of distributions (Debian,
Fedora, Arch, NetBSD, FreeBSD, etc..) use this concept to ensure
their packages are lean and clean. The documentation about it is more
extensive than I had imagined and there are many tool to help with
the process.</p></li>
<li><p>systemd gui<br />

<a href="https://github.com/pentix/qjournalctl">https://github.com/pentix/qjournalctl</a></p>

<p>Those are my first finds about systemd graphical service manager and

a sorrow reminder of the Windows-like aspect of systemd internals.</p></li>

<p>There's nothing particular about OpenBSD in this document, it does
a good job at hovering the advantages and complexities (interface,
computational, space, implementation) of one type over another. There's
a tool to calculate interface complexity that is linked in the Appendix
(I couldn't extract it from the document though so this remains to
be tested).</p></li>

<p>Yes, I'm talking about the "state of the internet" type of
articles. Tighten your belt because we've actually advanced in the
discussion. We've now reached the Messiah stage where if someone has
"insights" on the matter or "disconnects" they get a surge of visions of
the world and are now entitled to extract facts from subjectivity. Kind
of admirable how the interviewers and spectators are captivated by
the paranoia and conspirational theories, I guess that's one deep
dark perverse pleasure we have. Well done guys! (Please tell me if

<p>More on Linux! Documentation about proc is scarce and the tldp makes
a good at regrouping all the info. Going back to issue 41 "Almost
everywhere but not POSIX" and the <code>/proc/sys/kernel/ctrl-alt-del</code>

<p>Those are impressive. The level of skills required for those is beyond
my imagination. The second article is full of insightful information
about early day Unix such as: "The ';' escape sequence put that terminal
in full-duplex mode. Hence, the UNIX greeting message contained this
sequence. A terminal that does not understand this sequence, such as
our GBA TTY, would print the semi-colon.".</p></li>

paradigm isn't the recommended one.</p></li>

  all free, completely free. We can each do any damn thing we want. Which
  is more than most of us dare to imagine." – Jean-Paul Sartre talking

<h2>Unix</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>More of "terminal recording"<br />
<a href="https://intoli.com/blog/terminal-recorders/">https://intoli.com/blog/terminal-recorders/</a></p>

<p>This is a follow up of issue 48 "Capturing and debugging user
interaction on the shell". This blog regroups a gigantic extensive
list of all available options to record the terminal.</p></li>
<li><p>Food for thoughts<br />
<a href="http://turnoff.us/geek/inside-the-linux-kernel/">http://turnoff.us/geek/inside-the-linux-kernel/</a></p>

<p>This gets you thinking about the architecture... Anthropomorphizing
our mystic view of the order of things. Hey, we might find ourselves
in a future where we refer to computers the same way we refer to
mythological gods!</p></li>
<li><p>Missing games?<br />
<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/">https://www.gamingonlinux.com/</a></p>

<p>An addition to issue 10 "Free games", it seems like we're referencing
a lot of old issues, right?</p></li>
<li><p>The year of the Linux desktop<br />
<a href="http://itvision.altervista.org/why.linux.is.not.ready.for.the.desktop.current.html">http://itvision.altervista.org/why.linux.is.not.ready.for.the.desktop.current.html</a></p>

<p>More Linux specific topic for this newsletter! Self proclaimed: "the
most comprehensive list of Linux distributions' problems on the entire
Internet". On a side note, the person writing the article got other
interesting ones on the blog such as a list of good fonts and more
"this is best, this is worse"-kind of articles.</p></li>
<li><p>What's a thread<br />
<a href="https://www.schneems.com/2017/10/23/wtf-is-a-thread/">https://www.schneems.com/2017/10/23/wtf-is-a-thread/</a></p>

<p>This was mostly explained in the podcast about processes
(<a href="https://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=2141">https://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=2141</a>) however if explanation
with BIG fonts and icons are your thing then this will really help.</p></li>

<p>Recently I found myself wanting to do a simple implementation of a FAT16
fs manipulation tool and this is the resource I looked into. FAT is
easy to grasp and should get you started in the world of file systems
(well, I say that but I didn't dig into the technical implementation
of other file systems myself. The related podcast about data storage

<p>Yet again on this railroad of "the state of the internet" articles. Like
it or not it seems like a trend and it's fun to watch everyone going
through the "Oh I just woke up to what the internet is about". You
can't blame the trend, once you learn something you start to see
it everywhere and want to shout your lungs out. Digital literacy
is going up, non-technical persons are starting to be interested in
the details. For us it's old news. It's also interesting how internet
services are regarded as God-like entities that influences us and that
we have to please, in the end the writers of those articles have to
realize they can't anthropomorphize them, they can't consider them as
carrier of the holy good will for the masses. Post hoc ergo propter
hoc. This is not the internet this is their new religion; blaming it
for the good days and bad days. But can we critic this behavior in a
world that is frightening, slowly turning nihilistic, a world where
its people are looking for a Leviathan to bring back the order.</p></li>

<p>I wasn't sure last week if I should put the web rants in the Unix
section or not. I think they fit somehow. Those two articles related to
the "state and birth of the internet" + nostalgia kind of blog posts
that are popular these days. Don't get me wrong, I love this kind of
discussions, apart from the rosy retrospection there's some truth in
them especially the kind of discoveries you make. The first link has
a lot of politics and marketing topics, if you don't like that then
skip it.</p></li>

<h2>Unix</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Don't REBOOT IT!<br />
<a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2623441/unix/when-in-doubt--reboot--not-unix-boxes.html">https://www.infoworld.com/article/2623441/unix/when-in-doubt--reboot--not-unix-boxes.html</a></p>

<p>A web-encyclopedia about DEC terminals, I like the history and reference
manual pages. Those manual are thorough, even documenting things such
as the arrow keys and their functions which we take for granted today:
"Cursor down (0138) causes the cursor to move down one line until the
cursor reaches the bottom line. Once the cursor is in the bottom line,
receipt of the cursor down code has no effect."</p></li>

<p>During my research for the podcast about licenses I've learned that

<p>This sounds highly surprising but it's true, though it's not really awk
but Arcan, think image magic piping style-like. Arcan is a multimedia
framework (lua like). It is an impressive project, manipulating media

<p>Those are about files I/O and different ways to read/write them, the
first post is specific to the drawbacks of page disk caching (why not
buffer?) on Linux and the second about generic POSIX I/O. The first
article confuses a bunch of terms together but it's still fine. The
second one argues the basic POSIX as a bottleneck to speed (metadata
and permission checks, file descriptors, etc..).</p></li>

<h2>Unix</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Unix Papa<br />
<a href="http://unixpapa.com/incnote/">http://unixpapa.com/incnote/</a></p>

<p>YACB (Yet another cool blog), this one page I've linked focuses on
Unix compatibilities in C programming. There's a lot of good content
and myth busters in there.</p></li>
<li><p>A talk about bloat<br />
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbv9L-WIu0s&amp;list=PL-F6yzP-Y8RV234eFdp0BKPLV19rk2g2k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbv9L-WIu0s&amp;list=PL-F6yzP-Y8RV234eFdp0BKPLV19rk2g2k</a><br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asmutils">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asmutils</a></p>

<p>Yet again a rewrite of GNU utils. If you've listened to the podcast
about unix file hierarchy then you'd like to know that one of the
speaker worked the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard.</p></li>
<li><p>File system forensic<br />
<a href="http://www.campus64.com/digital_learning/data/cyber_forensics_essentials/info_file_system_forensic_analysis.pdf">http://www.campus64.com/digital_learning/data/cyber_forensics_essentials/info_file_system_forensic_analysis.pdf</a></p>

<p>I'm halfway through this book, it's wonderfully written and is helping
a lot in my current research. I'm not so sure if it's freely available
or not, if not then I'm sorry about that, I highly recommend getting it.</p></li>
<li><p>Linux sys call table<br />
<a href="http://thevivekpandey.github.io/posts/2017-09-25-linux-system-calls.html">http://thevivekpandey.github.io/posts/2017-09-25-linux-system-calls.html</a><br />

<p>This is already in the docs but having it in a table with the list of
registers is handy.</p></li>
<li><p>It's a UNIX System!<br />
<a href="https://github.com/3dfsb-dev/3dfsb">https://github.com/3dfsb-dev/3dfsb</a></p>

<p>A remake of the old 3d explorer. Not practical but a fun program to

<p>Support for ZFS is baked in Ubuntu 16.04 for server.</p></li>
<li><p>OSI for the web 3.0<br />
<a href="http://davidad.github.io/blog/2014/04/24/an-osi-layer-model-for-the-21st-century/">http://davidad.github.io/blog/2014/04/24/an-osi-layer-model-for-the-21st-century/</a></p>

<p>I'm quite found of his proposal but standards are hard to shatter,
but again, the OSI layers are about theory and not something that
products depend on.</p></li>
<li><p>So many tracing tools it makes me dizzy<br />

<h2>Thoughts</h2>

<p>Those are sentences that have resonated a lot with me the past few days.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To worship a phenomenon because it seems so wonderfully complex is to worship your own ignorance.<br />
  If a phenomenon feels complex, that is a fact about our state of knowledge, not a fact about the phenomenon itself.<br />
  Complexity is a property of questions, not answers.</p>

second one is: <strong>Learn Enough Command Line to Be Dangerous is an

<p>Is optimization evil? What if we become cyborgs, are we still not

for a while but was afraid to read it all until now. Good luck with
that everyone! I highly advice listening to the podcast about processes
before tackling this if you aren't familiar with memory. It's actually
perfectly explained and I love the explanation of the tools and <code>proc</code>
in the end.</p></li>

<p>Hek, the other day I was fixing a bug in a java code where there was an
undefined behavior while casting from Byte to byte[], I just imagine
how hard it can be to work on C projects that face the whole world
in production-mod and not just hobby projects. Sure C is fun but it's
hard to make it solid. This list is so extensive... and why do I know
about most of those when I only do C for fun, this should be left to
compiler developers, but in C-land it isn't (Just do sanitization with
your compiler... Or maybe not, it might break).</p></li>

<li><p>Linux - Am I SSD or not?<br />

<p>Here's the relevant commit adding a kernel parameter that shows if a
storage device is rotational (HDD) or not (SSD).</p></li>
<li><p>A typical sys-admin story<br />
<a href="https://www.ivankuznetsov.com/2010/02/no-space-left-on-device-running-out-of-inodes.html">https://www.ivankuznetsov.com/2010/02/no-space-left-on-device-running-out-of-inodes.html</a></p>

<p>This is the kind of subject that you need to grasp, otherwise when
you run into the issue you are left wondering for hours why it's
happening. Here the disk isn't full but it says it's full.</p></li>
<li><p>Store Bash history in Sqlite3<br />

<p>Not a fan of adding sqlite into the mix but I can sympathize with
having large shell history files that you might want to keep track of.</p></li>
<li><p>Loop device<br />

<a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/losetup">https://linux.die.net/man/8/losetup</a></p>

<p>An example of how to setup a loop device. The boschs project itself
is interesting, this needs to be checked too.</p></li>
<li><p>udev rules<br />
<a href="http://reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html">http://reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html</a><br />
<a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/udevadm.html">https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/udevadm.html</a></p>

<p>I've been creating simple udev rules lately and was studying how this
could be done. So let's all refresh our memory together.</p></li>
<li><p>pthread scheduling on FreeBSD and Linux<br />
<a href="http://www.icir.org/gregor/tools/pthread-scheduling.html">http://www.icir.org/gregor/tools/pthread-scheduling.html</a></p>

<p>Get down to the low level scheduling you can apply to threads and
learn how they differ between FreeBSD and Linux (threads as processes).</p></li>

<p>A benchmark from 2003 comparing Solaris UFS and RHEL ext3. Both of those
OS have switched their default filesystems today, so it's interesting
to look at the past. Usually Phoronix is <em>the</em> place to go when it
comes to benchmarking but they used their own suite which doesn't
always give some insights about how to do benchmarks yourself. The
article also teaches you some benchmarks tricks, which is neat.</p></li>

<p>I keep wondering at which point this was added in <code>useradd</code> but can't
find any date, it's in POSIX. In older Unix accounts were created using

<p>Related to the previous video, it's funny when you look at the marketing
aspect of Unix, the feud (Unix) wars and partnership between companies,
some partnering with others you wouldn't guess. For example in the last
video you had the Sun386i which ran DOS and UNIX on the same machine and
using the OpenLook design by Sun partnering with AT&amp;T plus some licensed
technology from Xerox corporation. You also had the HP360 using the OSF
Motif tech from both DEC, IBM, and HP. Then the Mac2cx by NextStep with
the MAC user interface which was the cheapest of them all, unlike today's
Apple product.</p>

<h2>Thoughts</h2>

<p>By the way: I was a mediocre writer whenI started out. Explaining
technical concepts is hard. Coming up with good examples takes time, and
explaining a diicult concept takes time. So it’s easiest to gloss over
the hard stuf. I thought I was doing a pretty good job, until ater one
of my posts got popular, a coworker came up to me and said, “I read
your post and I still don’t understand this.” I still had a lot to
learn about writing.</p>

<h2>Unix</h2>

<ul>
<li>Goosebumps - Linux version<br />
<a href="https://www.linux.com/news/spooky-linux-urban-legends">https://www.linux.com/news/spooky-linux-urban-legends</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Brace yourself for some horror stories.</p>

<ul>
<li>I HATE Linux!<br />
<a href="http://whylinuxisbetter.org/">http://whylinuxisbetter.org/</a><br />
<a href="http://boycottlinux.org/">http://boycottlinux.org/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>To continue with the horror stories, there are many arguments on the
internet about Linux and it's purity as a Unix system. Some of those
arguments are just to be discarded, others are serious. Like any criticism
if it's not constructive you have to take it lightly.</p>

<ul>
<li>But then Linux can be UNIX if you take it seriously<br />
<a href="https://blog.opengroup.org/2017/02/14/do-one-thing-and-do-it-well/">https://blog.opengroup.org/2017/02/14/do-one-thing-and-do-it-well/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>All that is required is that it stays stable for the enterprise world by
following the POSIX and Open Group standards. The EulerOS 2.0 and K-UX
3.0, derived from Red-Hat prove that, even though they aren't derived
from the original UNIX and under the hood have a different architecture.</p>

<ul>
<li>And UNIX can be not so UNIX too<br />
<a href="http://mkremins.github.io/blog/unix-not-acceptable-unix/">http://mkremins.github.io/blog/unix-not-acceptable-unix/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>An article that goes to the root of the issue.</p>

<ul>
<li>Cool admin scripts<br />
<a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/specials.html">http://www.brendangregg.com/specials.html</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Some hilarious oldies scripts that could possibly be useful, such as
this one: <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/Specials/mkzombie_example.txt">http://www.brendangregg.com/Specials/mkzombie_example.txt</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Turbo button<br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_button">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_button</a><br />

<a href="http://www.cpukiller.com/">http://www.cpukiller.com/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The turbo button was one of those weird thing of the past that doesn't
mean much these days.</p>

<ul>
<li>Run everything on the web!<br />

</ul>

<p>To continue on with our series of links about JS and the web, here's
one that's not about emulation but about running a shell in the
browser. Last time I've heard of that it was about pwning websites
through web-shells. The last link, the research paper, gives another
interesting side to the story.</p>

<ul>
<li>Programming Gods<br />
<a href="http://kingjamesprogramming.tumblr.com/">http://kingjamesprogramming.tumblr.com/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Programmers get pissed off a lot by useless semantics, etymologies,
and epistemology. This is a fun way to put things back in
perspective, which reminds me of the new-age bullshit generator
(<a href="http://sebpearce.com/bullshit/">http://sebpearce.com/bullshit/</a>)</p>

<ul>
<li>Vim adventure!<br />
<a href="https://www.passweird.com/">https://www.passweird.com/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Last week I mixed up two links.. <a href="https://vim-adventures.com/">https://vim-adventures.com/</a> and
passweird, sorry 'bout that fellows. Vim adventure is a great and really
addictive way to learn about vim. Though, it's only free until lvl3.</p>

<h2>Unix</h2>

<ul>
<li>Unix all the way<br />
<a href="http://www.hioreanu.net/cs/cs552-unix.html">http://www.hioreanu.net/cs/cs552-unix.html</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Probably one of the best document I've read about "Explaining the whole of
Unix in one shot", he even uses the prompt "GREENSCREEN". I can't emphases
how good this page is. The author is a Google Engineer and has also
written a beautiful window manager ahwm ( <a href="http://www.hioreanu.net/cs/ahwm/">http://www.hioreanu.net/cs/ahwm/</a>
) which is especially well documented.</p>

<ul>
<li>Unix system call timeout<br />
<a href="https://eklitzke.org/unix-system-call-timeouts">https://eklitzke.org/unix-system-call-timeouts</a><br />
&lt;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13854530 (Dicussion on HN)></li>
</ul>

<p>Creating a timeout for a system call on Unix isn't very clean but isn't
very necessary either.</p>

<ul>
<li>Hacker Public Radio<br />
<a href="http://hackerpublicradio.org">http://hackerpublicradio.org</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I've linked to anonradio.net before and this one is similar but technology
oriented. You'll find a bunch of episodes on Unix there.</p>

<ul>
<li>Internet scavenger hunt V3.0<br />
<a href="https://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=2074">https://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=2074</a></li>
</ul>

<p>z3bra started the third edition of the scavenger hunt.</p>

<ul>
<li>Down to earth linux<br />
<a href="http://downtoearthlinux.com/">http://downtoearthlinux.com/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>A hilarious and well written blog about explaining "complex" Unix and
Linux topics to newcomers.</p>

<ul>
<li>Digital data hypochondriac<br />
<a href="http://usefulstuff.io/2016/03/backup-strategies-for-digital-hypochondriac/">http://usefulstuff.io/2016/03/backup-strategies-for-digital-hypochondriac/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>A story about digital data PTSD. we all cherish our data - so run your
backups and think about having less ties with your machine. The author
is a MacOS user so it'll only be relevant to the readers who are on
this OS however I really like the description of the state of mind he
got into which is the main reason I am sharing it.</p>

<ul>
<li>Want to replace the Unix shell?<br />
<a href="http://sange.fi/~atehwa/cgi-bin/piki.cgi/virtues%20of%20the%20unix%20shell">http://sange.fi/~atehwa/cgi-bin/piki.cgi/virtues%20of%20the%20unix%20shell</a></li>
</ul>

<p>A great post about the virtues of the Unix shell and why it is the way
it is.</p>

<ul>
<li>Self extracting directory<br />
<a href="http://makeself.io">http://makeself.io</a></li>
</ul>

<p>A cross-Unix shell script which creates a compressed file (many format
available) which can extract itself.</p>

<ul>
<li>The legendary Unix hacker<br />
<a href="http://www.lemis.com/grog/">http://www.lemis.com/grog/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>He's got the beard, he got the years, here's an impressive fellow.</p>

<ul>
<li>Original vi<br />
<a href="http://ex-vi.sourceforge.net/">http://ex-vi.sourceforge.net/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The original vi was based on ed, which was closed source. Now that ed
was released under the BSD license we can test the original vi code.</p>

<h2>Random</h2>

<ul>
<li>Why choose Unix?<br />
<a href="http://www.unix-japan.co.jp/why-unix/">http://www.unix-japan.co.jp/why-unix/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You would never guess why...</p>

<ul>
<li>Interdisciplinary researches<br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Media_Lab">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Media_Lab</a><br />
<a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/">https://www.media.mit.edu/</a><br />
<a href="https://www.santafe.edu/">https://www.santafe.edu/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>To innovate you have to see beyond your closed field of study.</p>

<h2>Thoughts</h2>

<p>This is the issue number 13.</p>

<p>It is weird that we associate so much with numbers
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13_(number)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13_(number)</a> some use it as a lucky number
and others as an unlucky one. Many benign things are culture dependent.</p>

<h2>Contribute</h2>

<p>There are many ways to contribute:</p>

<ol>
<li>If you find anything interesting you can contact venam on the
forums and that may be featured in the next newsletter.</li>
<li>Share it with your friends.</li>
<li>Share your point of view about the newsletter.</li>
<li>Open a thread on the forums to discuss one of the topics that has
been brought by reading this newsletter.</li>
<li>If you want to help with the forums server fees you can send something
to my (new) patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/venam or you can
ask dcat how you can help with the IRC.</li>

<h2>Unix</h2>

<ul>
<li>Android rewrite of libc<br />

</ul>

<p>If you were paid to rewrite glibc for embedded devices, how would it
be. Staying away from GPL is a big thing for corps.</p>

<ul>
<li>Staying POSIX shell compatible<br />
<a href="http://www.etalabs.net/sh_tricks.html">http://www.etalabs.net/sh_tricks.html</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Writing shell scripts is hard when you have to support POSIX shell,
here are some tricks to make it easier. Keep that bookmarked.</p>

<ul>
<li>Linters<br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)</a><br />

<p>In a previous issue we linked to the <code>checkbashisms</code> tool. Let's widen
the scope to all cool linters.</p>

<ul>
<li>Rules!<br />

</ul>

<p>Code of conducts, rules, FAQ, README_BEFORE_FREAKING_POSTING, so many
documents writen to deter people from doing stupidities (or what that
group considers stupidity). Why not <code>cat | sort | uniq</code> those and take
the best? Would it amount to "Don't be a jackass"?</p>

<ul>
<li>The good, the bad, the ugly<br />
<a href="http://doc.cat-v.org/bell_labs/good_bad_ugly/slides.pdf">http://doc.cat-v.org/bell_labs/good_bad_ugly/slides.pdf</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Slides of a presentation by Rob Pike about the Unix heritage.</p>

<ul>
<li>A zoom into control characters and terminals<br />
<a href="http://catern.com/posts/terminal_quirks.html">http://catern.com/posts/terminal_quirks.html</a><br />

<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc20">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc20</a></li>
</ul>

<p>...And adding to this, before reaching the TTY the keybind has to pass by
maybe some program, some terminal emulator plugins, and the shell. You
can use the RFC as a reference for when you don't know what a control
character is suppose to do. Use <code>infocmp</code> and <code>script</code> to debug those.</p>

<ul>
<li>Terminals, mechanical keyboards, and mice<br />
<a href="http://terminals-wiki.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">http://terminals-wiki.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page</a><br />

<li>Professional video editing on Unix<br />

</ul>

<p>Davinci Resolve 12.5, a professional and proprietary software for video
editing, was recently ported to CentOS 6.x (Yeah, only one specific
distro). I'm not into video editing but as I've read the state of
professional video editing softwares on Unix is not so good.</p>

<ul>
<li>Bash is secure<br />
<a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/74527/setuid-bit-seems-to-have-no-effect-on-bash#74538">http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/74527/setuid-bit-seems-to-have-no-effect-on-bash#74538</a></li>
</ul>

<p>zsh, sh, and ksh don't do that. bash is protective and I personally
like that.</p>

<h2>Random</h2>

<ul>
<li>Modular living<br />
<a href="http://apis-cor.com/en/about/news/first-house">http://apis-cor.com/en/about/news/first-house</a><br />

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_building">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_building</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It really makes you think about how automated an free the world can
become. From 1946 to today where we're dreaming of seasteading and
modular houses built with 3d printers. What do you think?</p>

<h2>Thoughts</h2>

<p>Show me how you spend your day and I'll tell you what you care about.</p>

<p>http://ewanvalentine.io/how-to-never-complete-anything/><br />
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13816627">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13816627</a><br />

<p>Why complicate things? The software industry and programmers of today
are looking for too much achievements, stacking the "green blocks"
on GH, looking for confirmation of their existence, checking graphs
and statistics about their "progress", wanting to raise on the "SSI",
social selling index.</p>

<p>Let's slow down a bit! Small changes for a small group is more valuable
than running against titans</p>

<p>If it is useful to someone and kind of serves the purpose then that is
enough for a start.</p>

<p>Some many programs to help you keep track of what you want to do. As
for me a simple <code>at(1)</code> combined with notify-send is enough, what about you?</p>

<p>Again so many softwares doing the same thing, we need more comparative
reviews/articles about them. I don't have any personal favorite, I
would've liked to use terminal markdown viewer <code>mdv</code> but it doesn't
seem to respect everything I'm looking for. Hopefully there are many
<strong>in-browser</strong> markdown viewers.</p>

</ul>

<p>In the 80s the URSS had their own DEC’s PDP11 compabible cpu and thus
could run their own version of Unix-like OS derived from Unix Version 6.</p>

<p>You may want your cool short key but beware of collision.</p>

<ul>
<li>PAM Custom module<br />
<a href="http://www.semicomplete.com/projects/pam_captcha">http://www.semicomplete.com/projects/pam_captcha</a></li>

<h2>Thoughts</h2>

<p>The last episode of the nixers podcast took me a huge amount of
research unfortunately the audio recording didn't turn out as good as
I wanted (I was too tired.) You can read the transcript on the forums:
https://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=2052&amp;pid=17479#pid17479
I've learned quite a lot of things during the preparation and you
might too.</p>

<p>The thought of this week is: A community is a community because it's
community driven. Share your knowledge and your time with others, you're
running the show!</p>

<p>I love you guys.</p>
